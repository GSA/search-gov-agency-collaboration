## Prioritization

Q from Dawn to VA 10/29:
Thank you for showing which microsites are top 10, and I see also you made a 100 group and a 200 group. Are the sites currently without a priority somewhere in between 11 and 99, or are they low enough priority not to have a ranking at this time? Thanks.

A: 100 are more important than 200, but can go in any order, at any time.

  Q: If there is no priority, are those lower than 200? or higher than 100?
  
  A: If there is no priority assigned yet, it is _likely_ that these are more important than 100-level. I am working on getting at least a rough order in for those.
  
Q: Are urls case sensitive?

A: No. They are transcribed as derived from internal documents, but no URL as far as I am aware is specifically case sensitive.
