It can be spread using an aerosol spray, transmitted from person to person via close contact, and can survive in the environment up to one day, depending on ambient conditions. The fatality rate following infection is high, and there is no effective, approved treatment. Routine smallpox vaccination ended in the U.S. in 1972. Those who received the vaccination may experience a reduction in symptom severity and a decreased mortality rate, however, the infection rate and spread of disease amongst the general population is expected to be high. On September 23, 2004, the Secretary of Homeland Security determined that the smallpox virus is a material threat to the U.S. population sufficient to affect national security. Because the threat is credible and smallpox has the potential to cause significant casualties and massive disruption of political, economic, and social infrastructures in the U.S., strong efforts to reduce U.S. vulnerability to smallpox are warranted. As such, BARDA is supporting the development of both vaccines and antivirals that can protect against or treat smallpox. An effective antiviral treatment could mitigate the effects of smallpox disease. It is likely that such an antiviral may also be effective against other pox viruses. Smallpox Antivirals Program Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), and Pandemic and All-Hazards Reauthorization Act (2013) (PDF - 284 KB), BARDA’s strategy to support advanced development and procurement of critical medical countermeasures (MCMs) targets biothreats that have been determined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Material Threats. BARDA’s Smallpox Antiviral Program supports advanced development, procurement and stockpiling of variola major (smallpox) countermeasures for use in treating symptomatic smallpox. DHS issued a Material Threat Determination for smallpox in 2004, establishing it as a threat to national security. The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) BARDA has transitioned two antiviral drugs candidates—ST-246 (SIGA) and brincidofovir (Chimerix)—from NIH into advanced development and procurement under Project BioShield. ST-246 was procured under Project Bioshield in 2011 and delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), where it remains available for use under a CDC or DoD contingency IND or under Emergency Use Authorization. Brincidofovir is being developed for the treatment of smallpox, as well as for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and adenovirus infections associated with bone marrow transplantation. In addition to oral formulations of each drug, BARDA’s Smallpox Antiviral Program is supporting the development of a liquid suspension formulation of brincidofovir and a sprinkle formulation of ST-246 for special populations, including pediatric patients and individuals who are unable to swallow pills. BARDA is working towards meeting PHEMCE requirements for two antivirals with different mechanisms of action available to mitigate emergence of potential drug resistance. The smallpox antiviral drugs, in combination with the smallpox vaccines already stockpiled, will comprise a robust armamentarium of medical countermeasures to smallpox. With continuing development and regulatory approval of new diagnostic platform technologies through support from programs like Innovations and Biothreat Diagnostics, BARDA is improving our ability to rapidly detect and treat biothreats like smallpox in the entire U.S. population. Smallpox Vaccines Program Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), and Pandemic and All-Hazards Reauthorization Act (2013) (PDF - 284 KB), BARDA’s strategy to support advanced development and procurement of critical medical countermeasures (MCMs) targets biothreats that have been determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. BARDA’s Smallpox Vaccine Program focuses on maintaining sustainable and cost-effective vaccine stockpile capacity, with a goal of having enough smallpox vaccine for the entire Nation. This includes a vaccine for the general population and a vaccine for “at-risk”individuals (potentially contraindicated for a live replicating vaccine), complemented by antivirals with different mechanisms of action to treat individuals symptomatic with disease and by vaccinia immune globulin to treat adverse events associated with vaccination. This combination of MCMs will prepare the PHEMCE to appropriately respond to a smallpox incident. BARDA’s Smallpox Vaccines Program has supported advanced development of a third generation smallpox vaccine, IMVAMUNE® [smallpox Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine], for “at-risk” individuals to augment the vaccine for the general population. BARDA’s strategic goals for this vaccine candidate have focused on late stage development in support of potential licensure of IMVAMUNE®, and procurement under Project BioShield for delivery to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The current liquid frozen formulation of IMVAMUNE® is available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) during a declared emergency to special populations, including HIV+ persons and individuals with atopic dermatitis; to include all age ranges, pregnant women and/or nursing mothers. BARDA also is funding the advanced development of a lyophilized formulation of IMVAMUNE® that may have a significantly longer shelf life and easier cold chain logistics for storage and administration compared to its liquid frozen counterpart. Positive outcomes of the lyophilized formulation may include a reduction in total lifecycle management costs and a more sustainable stockpile of smallpox vaccine for immunocompromised individuals. The stockpiling and continued development of IMVAMUNE® ensures that the U.S. Government has a robust capability to vaccinate a diverse population during a smallpox emergency. In combination with BARDA’s antiviral development efforts, the Smallpox Vaccine Program has strengthened the current MCM armamentaria necessary to respond to a smallpox event.

MPS, also called tissue chips, are 3D biophysical platforms comprised of cellular constructs that mimic the structure and function of vital human tissues and organs, such as the lungs, liver, and heart. Accurately modeling human systems in vitro to test treatment effectiveness is a key step to accelerating the pace of drug discovery and development. However, predicting and testing the effects of therapeutics during early clinical studies is difficult, costly, time-consuming, and can fail to anticipate side effects in people. To safely and quickly evaluate a drug’s effectiveness and toxicity, researchers could utilize MPS in the early stages of studies. MPS may serve as a predictive tool in the drug development process, aid the screening of signaling molecules and drug targets, and help develop precision medicine-based therapies. Experts at BARDA expect that the use of advanced MPS will create new opportunities for understanding mechanisms of health and disease, and enable more efficient assessment of promising potential biomedical interventions. Recent rapid advances in this field now make the prospect of MPS commercialization and broad usability more realistic. Key challenges remain, however, including difficulty of manufacturing, integration and use of medically-relevant sensors, and the combination of multiple tissues anchored by the immune system to model the human body’s response. Under this EZ-BAA AOI, BARDA is seeking applicants with product ideas that focus on enhancing existing, fully-mature MPS that incorporate a human immune system component. These 3D platforms should include in-line sensors for continuous tissue monitoring, and utilize materials suitable for automated manufacturing and assembly of the platforms. Full proposals may be submitted until June 30, 2021. For more details, check out the Special Instructions 013, AOI #7 (PDF - 205KB) of the EZ-BAA (BAA-20-100-SOL-0002). The EZ-BAA was created to provide a streamlined process through which BARDA's Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) can review and accept applications for development funding of transformative products and technologies to protect Americans from health security threats.

On Dec. 11, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the vaccine for emergency use and doses began shipping immediately. The vaccine is being provided at no cost to Americans. Vaccine administration costs for private-sector administration partners are covered by healthcare payers: private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, and HHS’s program to cover COVID-19 costs for the uninsured which is reimbursing the provider at Medicare rates from the provider relief fund. Under the agreement, Pfizer will manufacture and deliver up to 100 million doses of its SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BNT162b2, to Government designated locations. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will deliver at least 70 million doses by June 30, 2021, with the balance of the 100 million doses to be delivered no later than July 31, 2021. The additional doses ordered today provide for a seamless transition from the first 100 million doses contracted earlier this year. This represents successful implementation of the U.S. government’s overall strategy to ensure continued availability of safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to Americans. This strategy began in spring 2020 with Operation Warp Speed (OWS) planning and has been consistent in all initial OWS contracts and agreements with industry partners supporting large scale manufacturing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Today’s agreement also includes options for an additional 400 Million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. As part of ongoing coordination, the government and Pfizer are also continuing to discuss potential approaches to further strengthen our partnership and safely expand output and accelerate production. “Securing more doses from Pfizer for delivery in the second quarter of 2021 further expands our supply of doses across the Operation Warp Speed portfolio,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “This new federal purchase can give Americans even more confidence that we will have enough supply to vaccinate every American who wants it by June 2021.” The agreement announced today brings the total doses of Pfizer’s vaccine purchased by the federal government to 200 million. Pfizer began manufacturing the first 100 million doses while clinical trials were underway. Manufacturing in parallel with clinical trials expedited the traditional vaccine development timeline and built toward the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed goal to begin delivering safe and effective vaccines to the American people by the end of the year. This goal has been achieved with the initial distribution of the Pfizer vaccine beginning immediately after the Food and Drug Administration granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, has now collaborated with the DOD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) and Army Contracting Command - New Jersey to provide Pfizer approximately $4B total for the delivery of 200 million doses of the vaccine to Government-designated locations across the country. The Pfizer vaccine was developed using messenger RNA, also called mRNA; mRNA vaccines take advantage of the process that cells use to make proteins in order to trigger an immune response and build immunity to a virus. In contrast, most vaccines use weakened or inactivated versions or components of a disease-causing virus to stimulate the body’s immune response to create antibodies. About Operation Warp Speed: OWS is a partnership among components of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, engaging with private firms and other federal agencies, and coordinating among existing HHS-wide efforts to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

With the potential for self-administration, these technologies could also expand the range of available care settings, allowing for wider coverage and ultimately improving the capability to reach herd immunity for many diseases. BARDA will explore the feasibility of two innovative approaches with four new partners: Esperovax, Inc., the University of Connecticut, Vaxess Technologies, and Verndari, Inc. The novel routes of administration they are developing could reduce the dependence on needles and syringes that are used to deliver vaccine via intramuscular injection. Instead, a wearable skin patch or oral option for vaccines may support rapid, large-scale immunization while reducing the strain on the manufacturing supply chain. The Egress RDTM mRNA oral cellular delivery technology from Esperovax, Inc. is a technology aiming to provide a cost-effective immunization that improves uptake with the potential for self-administration. The other vaccine technologies – from the University of Connecticut, Vaxess and Verndari – collectively known as Micro Array Patches (MAP), would deliver vaccine using a microneedle patch worn on the skin as an alternative to standard inoculation. With support from BARDA, the four partners will each advance the development of their respective products, formulate and optimize materials, and demonstrate their ability to effectively administer vaccine. If successful, these technologies could have a profound impact on the potential to offer better options to improve vaccine coverage. About the companies: The following information is provided by company and does not indicate endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products. Esperovax:Esperovax looks to become the global leader in oral tablet/capsule vaccinations for some of the world's deadliest treatable diseases by leveraging its new oral vaccine platform. Their delivery system holds the potential to provide billions of doses annually that could be delivered by mail and consumed directly by the consumer without the need to visit a healthcare setting. The oral platform holds a potential for significant expansion of vaccination to the most vulnerable and in need, at a fraction of traditional cost. The University of Connecticut (UConn):Dr. Nguyen and his lab at UConn have developed a process to manufacture a vaccine microneedle (MN) skin patch that only requires single-time administration to automatically deliver vaccine antigens repeatedly, similar to the use of multiple bolus injections, over a long period. They have shown that the MNs can deliver a clinical vaccine of Prevnar-13 against the pneumococcal infection (which causes pneumonia like COVID-19). They have started the study on the S-protein from a small urgent funding from UConn, School of Engineering to test/stabilize the S-protein (as a COVID-19 vaccine) in their MNs, and evaluate the antigenicity of the vaccine MNs (with only single administration) for a long-term immune-protection in an animal model. Vaxess Technologies, Inc.:Vaxess is developing next-generation vaccines that are not only more protective but also more accessible for people at home and around the world. Vaxess is developing its proprietary MIMIX™ therapies based on technology originally developed at Tufts University and MIT. With just minutes of wear-time, the shelf-stable, self-applied MIMIX™ patch enables sustained release of treatments in the skin over weeks to months. Vaxess is a venture-funded company that is also supported by the NIH, NSF, and DARPA. Verndari: Verndari, Inc. was founded in 2015 with the goal of transforming global health through next generation vaccine development and delivery. The privately held company based in Napa, California, aims to treat existing and emerging diseases, with rapid response to new viral threats such as COVID-19 as well as to produce more effective vaccinations for existing viruses, such as influenza, enabling delivery at lower cost to populations around the world. Verndari’s unique VaxiPatch™, a single-dose vaccination kit using a microneedle dermal technology, offers advantages that include dose sparing, improved efficacy, and pain-free delivery - while making vaccine administration much simpler. The technology eliminates the need for refrigeration and facilitates high-volume automated manufacturing of vaccines. Through innovation in vaccine science, Verndari aims to address many different diseases and to save countless lives. For more information on Verndari, please visit https://verndariinc.com.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/influenza-and-emerging-infectious-diseases/influenza-vaccine-development-programs/","Influenza Vaccine Development Programs",,"Skip to main content U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Influenza Vaccine Development Programs The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (November 2005) (PDF - 710 KB) and The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (2006) (PDF - 404 MB) directed HHS to build a domestic manufacturing surge capacity able to provide pandemic influenza vaccine for the entire country, and to establish a pre-pandemic influenza vaccine stockpile to immunize the critical workforce. To these strategic goals, BARDA aimed to provide more and better vaccines sooner by supporting initially the development of modern production technologies and adjuvants for the manufacturing of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. More recently BARDA addressed the need for better vaccines by supporting the development of more effective influenza vaccines with universal vaccine potential. With nearly a decade of BARDA investments, FDA has licensed since 2012 two (2) vaccines manufactured with cell- or recombinant-based technologies for seasonal influenza and a pandemic influenza vaccine formulated with a new oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant — all three of which were first-in-class influenza vaccines in the U.S. The following programs have augmented national pandemic influenza preparedness and response resources and capabilities and laid the foundation for BARDA’s new universal influenza vaccine initiative in 2015. Cell-Based Vaccine Program: Cell-based vaccines afford more rapid and flexible surge production for seasonal and pandemic influenza than older egg-based technologies in the U.S., and may provide less mismatched seasonal vaccines. BARDA support accelerated the pace of advanced development of six (6) cell-based influenza vaccines since 2006; and led to licensure of two (2) seasonal vaccines in Europe from Novartis and Baxter in 2009, and one seasonal vaccine in the U.S. (Flucelvax®) from Novartis in 2012. In June 2014, the FDA licensed Flucelvax®, manufactured at the Novartis facility in Holly Springs, NC, ensuring that cell-based seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines would be available for U.S. needs. BARDA continued to support one remaining set of cell-based seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine candidates with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) towards FDA licensure with the renewed support in 2015. Antigen-Sparing Vaccine Program: Since 2007, HHS/BARDA has supported directly four (4) projects for the advanced development of pandemic influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants, which may provide antigen-sparing, broad immunity across many influenza viruses, and prime-boost immunity for influenza vaccines. In November 2013, FDA licensed GlaxoSmithKline’s Q-PAN H5N1 pandemic vaccine with AS03 adjuvant, whose development was supported by BARDA. This was the first adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine licensed in the U.S. The availability and intrinsic properties of these adjuvants have increased our pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity multifold. Recombinant-Based Vaccine Program: Recombinant- and molecular-based technologies for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine development offer further options for meeting domestic pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing surge capacity goals. These technologies do not rely on the ability of influenza viruses to make vaccines and also may afford vaccine availability much sooner than egg- and cell-based technologies. In January 2013, FDA approved the licensure of FluBlǾk®, Protein Sciences Corporation’s recombinant-based seasonal influenza vaccine supported by BARDA. In October 2014, FDA expanded the age indication of FluBlǾk® from 18-50 years old to greater than 18 years old. Recently FDA approved the production of this vaccine at a U.S. manufacturing site with several fold greater production capability. Advanced development of other seasonal and pandemic recombinant-based influenza vaccine candidates from VaxInnate and Novavax continued in 2015 with Phase 2 clinical trials. Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Improvement Initiative: In response to a national need to develop optimized viruses for influenza vaccine production, BARDA established the IVMI Initiative and led collaborations among influenza vaccine manufacturers and influenza experts from BARDA, CDC, FDA, and NIH. IVMI support has enabled preparation of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) using synthetic genomics, and development and testing of potential virus backbone donors to confer higher antigen yield to CVVs in eggs and cells. Future goals include optimizing CVV and alternative potency assays and encouraging widespread adoption of rapid sterility assays for vaccine manufacturing to facilitate more rapid availability of seasonal and pandemic vaccines. BARDA Universal Influenza Vaccine Program: The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (November 2005) (PDF - 710 KB), the HHS Pandemic Influenza: Plan (2005) (PDF – 5.7 MB), and the The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (2006) (PDF - 404 MB) directed HHS to build a domestic manufacturing surge capacity able to provide pandemic influenza vaccine for the entire country and to establish a pre-pandemic influenza vaccine stockpile to immunize the critical workforce. To these strategic goals, BARDA aimed to provide more and better influenza vaccines sooner by supporting initially the development of modern vaccine production technologies and adjuvants to build capacity for the manufacturing of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. More recently BARDA addressed the need for better vaccines by launching in 2015 a new program to support the advanced development of more effective influenza vaccines with universal vaccine potential. The long-term aspirational goal is a truly universal influenza vaccine that elicits more effective and stronger immunity among all populations, longer-lasting and broader spectrum protective immunity against a wide range of divergent influenza strains for both seasonal and pandemic influenza, and that may serve as a primer vaccine for pandemic influenza vaccine and reduce the overall pandemic influenza vaccine demand. Currently NIH/NIAID and BARDA are partnering with industry and academia to develop and manufacture new universal influenza vaccine candidates for evaluation in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, BARDA launched its more effective influenza vaccine development program by releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on March 16, 2015, following consultation with interagency and industry partners. The development and potential licensure of more effective/universal influenza vaccines will address the need for a new and more effective vaccine that may provide ""influenza immunity for life"" and transform our pandemic influenza preparedness readiness and response capabilities.

The collaboration will increase manufacture of vaccine drug substance, as well as its fill-finish capacity – two of the biggest bottlenecks facing J&J in the production of its vaccine. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will collaborate with Merck to repurpose some of its existing Merck facilities for rapid large-scale manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics for use in public health emergencies including the current pandemic. The facilities will be available to private sector partners working with the federal government on the COVID-19 response or to produce Merck products against COVID-19. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, part of Johnson & Johnson, will be the first federal partner to use repurposed Merck facilities to manufacture COVID-19 vaccine. Merck will use two of its facilities to produce drug substance, formulate and fill vials of J&J’s vaccine. Consistent with the Administration’s mission to ensure that the United States has sufficient long term sustainable capacity to manufacture vaccines, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), will leverage the Defense Production Act to provide an initial investment of $105 million in funding for Merck, at the Administration’s request, to convert, upgrade and equip Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the vaccine. The company will address all the necessary qualification and validation activities needed for the facilities to be used for large-scale manufacturing. To further accelerate production of the J&J vaccine, President Biden also announced he has invoked the Defense Production Act to expedite materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery and supplies like single use bags, and he has directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide daily logistical support to strengthen J&J’s efforts. With the urging and assistance of the Administration, J&J also will begin operating its manufacturing facilities 24/7 to maximize production output. These efforts will contribute to J&J’s ability to accelerate delivery of their vaccine doses from 100 million doses by the end of June to at or near 100 million doses by the end of May. In the long term, these actions will ultimately double J&J’s U.S. capacity to produce drug substance and increase the U.S. capacity for fill-finish.

These treatments would use antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 survivors and are intended to stimulate the immune systems of people currently ill from the virus. To facilitate the development of these investigational treatments the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, is providing support to the American Red Cross; Emergent BioSolutions of Gaithersburg, Maryland; Grifols USA of Los Angeles, California, and SAb Biotherapeutics, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “We are working with partners across the federal government and private industry to make safe and effective treatments available as soon as possible in this pandemic,” said BARDA Director Rick Bright, Ph.D. “Together, we are hyper focused on a single goal, to save lives.” The products in development include convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin; both are based on the blood plasma of people who have recovered from a disease. Convalescent plasma contains antibodies produced by the immune system to fight bacteria or viruses. Investigational convalescent plasma that is collected from blood donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 may contain antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Using convalescent plasma may help other COVID-19 patients recover from the disease more quickly, while giving them more time to develop their own antibodies to fight the infection. Hyperimmune globulin is a product developed by concentrating antibodies found in convalescent plasma. Currently, there are no COVID-19 treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the FDA is playing a role in a national effort to facilitate the development of, and access to, convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin as investigational treatments for COVID-19. As part of the national effort, BARDA is collaborating with the American Red Cross to set up the systems and procedures needed to recruit donors and collect, store, and distribute convalescent plasma donated by patients who have recovered from COVID-19. BARDA also expanded a long-standing public-private partnership with Emergent BioSolutions. Emergent will collect donated plasma and use the company’s hyperimmune platform to develop and manufacture COVID-19 hyperimmune globulin (COVID-HIG). The platform was established in partnership with BARDA to produce hyperimmune globulin to treat anthrax. Emergent also will work with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, to include the COVID-HIG in future clinical trials to evaluate the product’s use in treating patients with COVID-19. Through a partnership with BARDA and the Department of Defense’s Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND), Grifols will produce convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin. With the support of BARDA, Grifols will collect plasma through a network of more than 250 plasma donor centers in the United States to manufacture COVID-19 convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin. These products can be used in controlled clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy as treatments for COVID-19. Through a partnership with BARDA and JPEO-CBRND’s Medical CBRN Defense Consortium, SAb Biotherapeutics will develop a unique immunotherapy called SAB-185. The product, part of a new class of immunotherapies, relies on SAb’s platform technology to produce human antibodies without donated human blood from patients who have recovered from the virus. This approach produces greater quantities of the product than the traditional methods that rely on donated blood. SAb will complete manufacturing of the immunotherapy product and conduct preclinical studies. BARDA could support a Phase 1 clinical trial, for initial testing in humans.

Visit FDA for more details. HHS accepts donations of medicine to Strategic National Stockpile as possible treatments for COVID-19 patients FDA issues emergency use authorization for donated hydroxychloroquine sulfate, chloroquine phosphate The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division, and one million doses of chloroquine phosphate donated by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, for possible use in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials. These and other companies may donate additional doses, and companies have ramped up production to provide additional supplies of the medication to the commercial market. “President Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Scientists in America and around the world have identified multiple potential therapeutics for COVID-19, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The President’s bold leadership and the hard work of FDA and HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response have succeeded in securing this large donation of medicine. We’ll continue working around the clock to get American patients access to therapeutics that may help them battle COVID-19, while building the evidence to evaluate which options are effective.” HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) worked with colleagues within HHS, the companies, the Department of State, and the Department of Homeland Security to secure the donated shipments. Given the importance of understanding the efficacy of these medications for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, federal agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and ASPR’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), are working together to plan clinical trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to BARDA to allow hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating COVID-19 be made available to health care providers and patients, including the known risks and drug interactions. The SNS, managed by ASPR, will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ship donated doses to states. The SNS does not regularly stock either drug. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate are oral prescription drugs approved to treat malaria and other diseases. Although there are no currently approved treatments for COVID-19, both drugs have shown activity in laboratory studies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective. When the Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that issuance of an EUA is appropriate, the FDA has the regulatory emergency use authority to facilitate access to unapproved medical countermeasures or unapproved uses of approved medical countermeasures needed to prepare for and respond to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. An EUA may be issued if the FDA determines that, among other criteria, the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat the identified disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, and there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. Emergency access to a medical product under an EUA is separate from use of a medical product under an investigational drug application. The FDA has issued an EUA for multiple diagnostics, for several other medical devices such as respiratory devices and a system for decontaminating them to allow for their reuse, and ventilators and ventilator equipment for the COVID-19 response. This is the first EUA for a drug related to the COVID-19 response. Sandoz and Bayer are the latest companies stepping up to strengthen the U.S. response to COVID-19, and ASPR is working with additional companies willing to donate doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Companies interested in donating goods or services should contact fema-nrcc-iagsupv@fema.dhs.gov or visit https://www.fema.gov/coronavirus/how-to-help. Use of the donated medications is expected to help ease supply pressures for the drug, and the FDA is also working with manufacturers of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to increase production to ensure these drugs also remain available for patients dependent on them for treatment of malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Some states and retail pharmacies also have taken action to preserve the supply of these and other drugs for these patients. In addition to accepting and distributing the donated medicines, HHS is funding clinical trials of two drugs, Kevzara (sarilumab) and remdesivir, and is supporting the earlier development of multiple potential therapeutic treatments, vaccines, and diagnostic tests for COVID-19. HHS continues to seek partners for COVID-19 medical countermeasures, and offers multiple ways to submit proposals for potential products or technologies.

BARDA is providing program management support and up to $144 million in funding from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act for the Phase 2/3 clinical trial (KidCOVE, NCT04796896) to include approximately 7,000 children ages six months to less than 12 years old. The study, which is currently underway, represents the next step in protecting people of all ages from COVID-19 and help reduce the spread of the virus within the U.S. Results from a BARDA-supported Phase 2/3 clinical trial of this vaccine for adolescents, ages 12-17 years old, were announced in May. Based on the results, the company applied for emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand use of the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in adolescents. Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), collaborated to develop mRNA-1273 and to conduct the clinical trials with adults and younger children (KIDCOVE). BARDA's support of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine candidate started in April 2020. This vaccine’s platform is the same one BARDA support to develop Moderna's Zika vaccine candidate starting in 2016. BARDA also has supported ongoing Phase 2 adult dose confirmation study and adding a crossover arm to the adult Phase 3 efficacy study (COVE) to provide the vaccine to people who received a placebo in the adult clinical trials. Moderna was the second company to be granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA for a coronavirus vaccine that uses messenger RNA (mRNA). Messenger RNA vaccines take advantage of the process that cells use to make proteins to trigger an immune response and build immunity to a virus. About Moderna: The following information is provided by the company and does not indicate endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products. Moderna Inc. is a leader in the discovery and development of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and therapeutics.

The deadly effects of ionizing radiation are wide-ranging and encompass both whole body and organ-specific damage. ARS typically includes a range of physical signs and symptoms that reflect severe damage to specific parts of the body, including the bone marrow, blood, the gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system. The particular organs affected depend, in part, upon the radiation exposure level and the susceptibility of the individual organs. At lower radiation levels, bone marrow effects occur that can lead to increased susceptibility to infection, anemia, and uncontrolled bleeding. At slightly higher radiation levels, the gastrointestinal tract can be damaged, causing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as the release of intestinal bacteria into the bloodstream that can further stress the depleted immune system. At the highest radiation levels, the brain, spinal cord, and lungs can be affected. These highest exposure levels are almost universally fatal, even with aggressive therapy. Even low doses of radiation can result in increased death if accompanied by physical injuries, infections, and/or blood loss. Long-term effects include loss of normal function or fibrosis in a wide range of organs and body tissues and, ultimately, a higher risk of cancer. In most cases, the deadly effects of higher doses of radiation exposure can be lessened by early appropriate triage and medical treatment decisions. Recovery of the blood system depends on prompt treatment, to preserve or enhance the ability of the remaining stem cells in the bone marrow and to divide and become mature blood cells to bring the immune and blood system back to working well enough to prevent otherwise fatal infections and internal bleeding. Other radiation injuries take more time to show up. This extra time provides an opportunity to give medications before full expression of radiation sickness, potentially saving lives. Cutaneous Radiation Injury Significant radiation exposure of the skin and underlying tissue may also cause Cutaneous Radiation Injury (CRI), also known as a radiation burn. The severity of the radiation burn depends largely on the magnitude of the radiation exposure. Exposure to large doses of radiation can damage the skin's cell layers, causing inflammation, reddening, and skin peeling. More severe exposures will result in hair loss, blistering, and skin ulceration. HHS has requirements for the capability to treat thousands of burn victims following a nuclear detonation. Also, burn wounds resulting from IND detonation are likely to be accompanied by blunt trauma, lacerations, and radiation-related injuries. Burn injuries which are full-thickness in nature would require autografts for treatment. Large burn injuries will also have immediate life-threatening complications. Although severe burns ultimately require skin grafting, these surgical procedures for definitive care can be delayed (for several days) if the appropriate field-care treatments are used. The need is particularly high to develop products for definitive care that can reduce the labor-intensity and resource-intensity of care for severe and widespread burns. Radioactive particles can also be taken into the body through inhalation, ingestion, or wound contamination, and can be absorbed into organs such as bone, liver, or lymph nodes. Once absorbed, the radioactive particles continue to emit ionizing radiation to the surrounding tissues, potentially leading to cell death, organ dysfunction, fibrosis, or malignancy. Rapid removal of these particles from the body is critical. Finally, in situations that result in people becoming internally contaminated with radioactive particles from fallout contamination or a radiological dispersal devices , special tests of blood, urine, sputum, hair, and skin/wound sites will help identify the radiation contamination of organ doses received. These tests will also show the success of therapy for removal of these particles from the body.

BARDA and MediciNova, Inc. have partnered to repurpose MN-166 (ibudilast) for potential use against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury associated with chlorine exposure. Repurposing MN-166 as an MCM for treatment after either accidental or intentional exposure to chlorine could help to improve patient health outcomes and save lives following exposure. Under the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) program, Repurposing Drugs in Response to Chemical Threats (ReDIRECT), BARDA will provide funding for proof-of-concept studies of MN-166 in preclinical models of chlorine-associated lung injury. MN-166 is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4 and other inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor. The anti-inflammatory effects of MN-166 and its reduction of pulmonary edema (swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body’s tissues) in preclinical ARDS mouse model studies present a compelling case for further investigation in models of chlorine-induced lung injury. MN-166 is the first compound to receive BARDA’s development support through DRIVe’s ReDIRECT program. The therapeutic is approved in Japan for the treatment of asthma and post-stroke complications. MediciNova is independently investigating it in the U.S. for COVID-19 patients that are at a high risk of developing ARDS. MN-166 has been evaluated in more than 21 ongoing or completed clinical trials under MediciNova’s management. Drug repurposing evaluates new uses, outside of the original clinical indication, for therapeutics that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or that are in late-stage development. Repurposing MN-166 as an MCM for treatment after either accidental or intentional exposure to chlorine could help to improve patient health outcomes and save lives following exposure. This award is just one component of BARDA’s Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) medical countermeasures and DRIVe’s medical countermeasures portfolios. Visit DRIVe’s ReDIRECT program to learn more.

Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the Biden Administration is investing more than $3 billion to accelerate the discovery, development and manufacturing of antiviral medicines as part of the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government strategy to develop the next generation of COVID-19 treatments. Through collaboration within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), this plan – called the Antiviral Program for Pandemics – will respond to the urgent need for antivirals to treat COVID-19 by spurring the availability of medicines to prevent serious illness and save lives. It also will build sustainable platforms for discovery and development of antivirals for other viruses with pandemic potential, helping better prepare the nation to face future viral threats. Even as hundreds of millions of Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19 and cases, hospitalizations and death rates fall, the Biden Administration remains committed to identifying effective treatment options that can prevent people diagnosed with COVID-19 from progressing to serious illness and death. Highly effective oral antiviral medicines that can be taken at home early in the course of infection, similar to antiviral treatment for influenza, would save lives both here and abroad and prevent overwhelming surges in hospitalizations. This plan will support research to identify and accelerate availability of breakthrough treatment options to ensure the public has access to viable medicines. “New antivirals that prevent serious COVID-19 illness and death, especially oral drugs that could be taken at home early in the course of disease, would be powerful tools for battling the pandemic and saving lives,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the President and NIAID Director. “Through multidisciplinary collaborations among leading scientists in academia and industry, this investment from the American Rescue Plan to create the Antiviral Program for Pandemics will help inspire medical innovation and build on the extraordinary success we have seen in developing the COVID-19 vaccines.” This plan accelerates and expands the Administration’s ongoing efforts to support clinical trials to test prioritized drug candidates for COVID-19 and to support the advanced development of promising therapies. Working through an unprecedented public-private partnership called ACTIV (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutics and Vaccines), 19 therapeutic agents have been prioritized for testing in rigorous clinical trials for outpatients and inpatients with COVID-19. Having additional FDA-authorized antiviral medicines available within a year would be a major breakthrough in ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19 and protect the public, which is why last week the Administration announced it would procure more than 1.5 million regimens of a Merck investigational antiviral treatment, should it receive emergency use authorization. “With the President’s leadership, this Administration has vaccinated millions of people. Even with very effective vaccines, some people may remain vulnerable to the virus, including people who are immunosuppressed or who are unvaccinated,” said Dr. David Kessler, Chief Science Officer for the Biden Administration’s COVID-19 Response. “An easily administered oral antiviral drug would be an important part of our therapeutic arsenal that would complement the great success of our vaccine efforts. Our Administration is going to harness the power of American ingenuity to spur the creation and development of these drugs that can save lives both here in the United States and around the world.” “The remarkable and rapid development of vaccines and testing technology has shown how agile scientific discovery can be when we combine the resources of public agencies, private entities, and our nation’s most brilliant and creative minds,” said Dr. Francis S. Collins, NIH Director. “We will leverage these same strengths as we construct a platform for the discovery and development of effective antivirals that will help us defeat COVID-19 and better prepare us for potential future viral pathogens.” As part of the plan announced today, the NIH will evaluate, prioritize and advance antiviral candidates to Phase 2 clinical trials, using current and expanded contract resources and the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences laboratories to de-risk early stage development with sponsors and guide candidates along development paths. The plan provides more than $300 million for research and lab support, nearly $1 billion for preclinical and clinical evaluation, and nearly $700 million for development and manufacturing through NIAID and BARDA. “This plan builds on the long, successful partnership between BARDA and NIH to develop vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, from combatting Ebola, anthrax and smallpox, to now tackling COVID-19,” said BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “Throughout this public health emergency, we have worked with industry to develop treatments to reduce severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths, and this proposal will help us go even further to accelerate and deliver more safe and effective treatments that are easy to administer.” Additionally, the plan allocates up to $1.2 billion to support the creation of collaborative drug discovery groups called Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Centers for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern that will harness the creativity of the biomedical research community and drive innovative antiviral drug discovery and development. These centers will create platforms that will initially target coronaviruses, and then could be expanded to other viruses with pandemic potential – helping to better prepare the nation for future viral threats.

The PHEMCE Strategy The first stage is the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Threats (HHS PHEMCE Strategy). The purpose of the HHS PHEMCE Strategy is to establish the goals and objectives that HHS will use to ensure that medical countermeasures are available for effective use against the highest priority CBRN threats facing the Nation. The HHS PHEMCE Strategy considers the full spectrum of medical countermeasure-related activities, including research, development, acquisition, storage and maintenance, deployment, and utilization. The draft PHEMCE Strategy was published for public comment in the Federal Register on September 8, 2006. The final version of the PHEMCE Strategy reflects comments received through the Federal Register as well as critical input gained at the BioShield Stakeholders Workshop held September 25-26, 2006. The final PHEMCE Strategy was published in the Federal Register on March 20, 2007. Full Text: HHS PHEMCE Strategy (PDF - 74.4 KB)* Together, Medical Countermeasures against Weapons of Mass Destruction and the HHS PHEMCE Strategy outline the principles and processes for identifying priority threat areas and requirements for medical countermeasure development and acquisition, including those medical countermeasures to be developed or acquired under the authorities of the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (""Project BioShield"") (P.L.. 108-276) or under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417). Medical Countermeasures against Weapons of Mass Destruction and the HHS PHEMCE Strategy also set forth the overall roles and responsibilities of key government agencies contributing to this effort. The PHEMCE Implementation Plan The second stage is the HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Threats. The HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan is prioritized plan with near-term (FY07-08), mid-term (FY09-13) and long-term (FY14-23) goals for research, development, and acquisition of medical countermeasures that is consistent with the guiding principles and priority setting criteria defined in the HHS PHEMCE Strategy. The HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan is supported by a number of HHS funding streams, including NIH biodefense research and development, advanced development monies, Strategic National Stockpile resources and the Special Reserve Fund authorized under Project BioShield.

(PDF - 162 KB) (PL 108-90) and supplement (PL 108-106 Sec. 1201) PDF - 162 KB) signed by President Bush on October 1, 2003, created a discretionary reserve of $5.6 billion to fund the program through FY2013. An amount not to exceed $3.4 billion may be obligated during FY2004-2008. Funding is available for countermeasures once production of licensable products is judged scientifically feasible. HHS will be the procuring authority. Amounts appropriated become available only upon approval by the President. On October 21, 2004, the President directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to perform the functions vested in the President under Section 319F-2 of the Public Health Service Act. In March 2013 Congress passed and the President signed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act (PAHPRA) (PDF - 284 KB), Public Law No. 113-5. The 2013 law builds on work the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has undertaken to advance national health security. These include authorizing funding for public health and medical preparedness programs, such as the Hospital Preparedness Program and the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement, amending the Public Health Service Act to grant state health departments greatly needed flexibility in dedicating staff resources to meeting critical community needs in a disaster, authorizing funding through 2018 for buying medical countermeasures under the Project BioShield Act, and increasing the flexibility of BioShield to support advanced research and development of potential medical countermeasures. PAHPRA also enhances the authority of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to support rapid responses to public health emergencies. Under PAHPRA, BARDA was appropriated for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 at least $415 million for advanced research and development and $2.8 billion over five years for Project BioShield.

This partnership will leverage PeraHealth’s expertise in machine learning (ML)-powered software design to build risk triage tools based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared Rothman Index (RI), an ML-derived algorithm. Providing a risk assessment of deterioration for patients entering the emergency department can help health care professionals determine the most appropriate level of care for patients to improve outcomes and optimize hospital resources. The RI Risk Triage app is being developed with partner hospitals to optimize workflow, assess user feedback, and explore feasibility of wide deployment during the pandemic. In addition, the app will also be adapted for non-COVID-19 patient assessment to have continued impact as the pandemic wanes. During emergency responses to major public health threats such as pandemics, risk assessment and patient triage tools are critical to ensuring that patients are provided the best possible life-saving care. Anticipating patient trajectory and the potential for physiological decompensation can also help optimize the allocation of, at times, very limited resources. The goal of this project is to make this RI Risk Triage app widely available to U.S. hospitals via a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-secure cloud-based application, which could greatly improve response to current health threats and preparedness for future challenges.

Under a BARDA contract award, Visby will expand the company’s SARS-COV-2 test, which achieved emergency use authorization (EUA) to include a multiplexed Flu A and Flu B respiratory test with the goal of emergency use authorization (EUA) and, ultimately, 510(k) clearance. The Visby Personal PCR test is being developed to help diagnose and distinguish rapidly between cases of influenza A, influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 viral infections from a single nasal swab sample, facilitating decisions about appropriate patient care and management including quarantine, as necessary. The hand-held disposable device platform is expected to provide a sample-to-result time of less than 30 minutes. The test requires no additional equipment and is designed for both point-of-care (POC) and over-the-counter (OTC) use at home, avoiding lengthy delays caused by sample transport, laboratory analysis, and result reporting. The potential OTC availability would greatly assist in minimizing patient exposure in POC settings and avoid the further spread of contagious viral infections in the current and potentially future pandemics to help save lives. The Visby SARS-COV-2 test was developed with support from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering’s RADx program, part of the National Institutes of Health. That test recently achieved Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

To lower production costs, reduce waste and improve yields of these ingredients, the team will use advanced manufacturing processes, including continuous manufacturing. The team will also complete a technology transfer of novel continuous manufacturing process to organizations or businesses designated by the U.S. government. Currently, a majority of APIs or their precursor chemical ingredients for critical medicines are manufactured outside the United States. They are typically manufactured using slower, less efficient processes. Shipping the ingredients or finished drugs to the U.S. also adds time that is not available during pandemics or other public health emergencies. The U.S. national medical supply also is placed at risk during a global health emergency when individual countries can close borders and potentially eliminate access to these critical materials. In addition to producing the active pharmaceutical ingredients, the team will expand advanced manufacturing capability in the U.S. to provide further capacity for producing finished generic drugs. The pandemic has created a surge in the number of hospitalized patients which may create a shortage of supplies of critical medicines. The team will be able to rapidly provide U.S. health care systems with finished, sterile, injectable generic medicines at risk of shortage. Under the four-year, $354 million agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at HHS, the Phlow-led team will manufacture the supplies for medicines for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The contract can be extended for up to a total of $812 million over a total of 10 years to maintain the system and supplies. “BARDA is committed to working with partners from the private sector and across the U.S. government to improve our nation’s health security,” said BARDA Acting Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “Utilizing advanced manufacturing processes increases the speed we can provide patients with treatments, reduces the likelihood of drug shortages, and increases U.S. readiness. Today we have taken an important step to strengthen our domestic drug production capability and respond to the increased need for medicines to treat COVID-19 patients during the current pandemic.” Phlow pursues their mission of securing the national supply of essential medicines through partnerships with pharmaceutical supply and manufacturing organizations including AMPAC Fine Chemicals, Civica Rx, and the Medicines for All Institute at the Virginia Commonwealth University’s College of Engineering. AMPAC is a custom API manufacturer with three large, domestic facilities for high-throughput, cGMP-grade (commercial Good Manufacturing Practices) production. Civica Rx (Civica, Inc.), a non-profit generic drug company, was established by hospital systems and philanthropies to alleviate drug shortages. Civica Rx currently provides 20 sterile injectable medications to over 1,200 hospitals that, according to the company, make up 30 percent of all licensed U.S. hospital beds. Working with manufacturing partners, Civica maintains an inventory reserve for many of their drugs that are used to treat COVID-19, such as vancomycin, ketamine, lidocaine, fentanyl, and morphine. The Medicines for All Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University’s College of Engineering is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing drug manufacturing processes. They develop and employ new chemical process technologies and manufacturing platforms by lowering cost, reducing waste, and improving yields.

This treatment, developed with BARDA support, has the potential to be one of the first therapeutics specifically designed to inhibit SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The therapeutic contains two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were initially identified from Regeneron’s proprietary genetically-humanized VelocImmune® mice and from COVID-19 convalescent patient blood and then expanded and manufactured in large quantities. The investigational antibody cocktail may help COVID-19 patients recover from the disease more quickly, while simultaneously giving the patients more time to develop their own antibodies to fight the infection. Regeneron is also planning to explore REGN-COV2’s potential for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in people who have not yet been infected by the virus. In order to address any potential mutation, a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and bind to non-overlapping regions of the virus’s spike protein was selected to reduce the chance that the virus would be able to ‘escape’ treatment and evolve into a treatment-resistant strain. With a multi-antibody approach, the virus would need multiple simultaneously mutations in multiple genetic locations in order to evade neutralization. These initial Phase 1/Phase 2 clinical trials will provide the first data on the safety and efficacy of the treatment in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patient volunteers with symptomatic COVID-19. Currently, there are no FDA-approved COVID-19 treatments.

The SolaVAXTM platform uses a proprietary technology to inactivate a virus with low risk to the patient. This project will demonstrate the utility of the SolaVAXTM process to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The technology is expandable with potential to advance vaccine manufacturing capabilities to meet vaccine needs globally. The SolaVAXTM process utilizes Riboflavin and UV light to carry out specific DNA and RNA chemistry with viral, bacterial or cellular agents that subsequently may be used in vaccine preparations. The photochemistry of Riboflavin and UV light has been shown to be specific to nucleic acids and not induce damage or modification to the viral protein antigens that serve as the immunogens in the host. By preventing replication of the target agent, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while minimizing or reducing the amount of peripheral damage caused, a particle can be generated that contains all the potential antigenic targets for immune response without the capacity for replication post-infection. Researchers at Colorado State University intend to test this platform with stock virus cultures grown in the CSU’s BioMARC BSL-3 facility, a cGMP compliant manufacturing facility operated by the University on a non-profit basis. BioMARC has the capability and capacity to produce large quantities of viruses, perform inactivation procedures, and operates BSL-3 labs safely for high-containment biological manufacturing operations. This facility was established as a Regional Center of Excellence and currently operates as part of the Regional Biocontainment/National Biocontainment laboratory network under the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. During this pandemic, the ability to produce large quantities of vaccines in a cost-effective manner is critical. The SolaVAXTM platform has already been shown to inactivate MERS-CoV, another virus in the coronavirus family, efficiently and has been evaluated for production in other types of vaccine delivery systems. The specific technology used in the SolaVAXTM platform provides for low toxicity and thus easy handling, distribution and manufacturing of vaccines. The technology may provide an inexpensive, fast, safe, clean, and potentially better inactivation technology than what is currently available.

The partnership will fund a multi-center clinical trial to validate the ability of Beckman Coulter’s FDA-cleared Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW) hematology biomarker, indicated to aid in the detection of adult sepsis, to identify MIS-C in children as well. In the United States, more than 1,000 children have been diagnosed with MIS-C since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. MIS-C is a rare but serious post-COVID-19 condition. Left untreated, the condition leads to serious, life-threatening complications, including hypotensive shock, cardiac aneurysm, or ventricular failure. The long-term implications are unknown. However, despite the severity, MIS-C diagnosis is difficult as the initial symptoms, such as fever or rash, are mild and variable. There are currently no cleared MIS-C diagnostics available. With widespread SARS-CoV-2 infections among children, which may increase as more schools resume in-person classes or move to hybrid models, there is an immediate need for methods to rapidly detect this severe complication. Early detection can help improve patient outcomes by prompting early treatment and appropriate clinical management. MDW is a FDA-cleared marker of sepsis for adults and used in emergency departments. Preliminary results from a study initiated at Massachusetts General Hospital revealed that the MDW hematology-based biomarker has the potential to aid in the rapid detection of MIS-C. This collaborative effort between Beckman Coulter and academic partners at Massachusetts General Hospital, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the University of Florida will seek to validate the effectiveness of the technology with a large, multi-center trial to support regulatory approval.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), was established by The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), December 2006 (PDF - 248 KB) to facilitate the research, development, and acquisition of medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, as well as for emerging infectious diseases like pandemic influenza. PAHPA was reauthorized in 2013 by the signing of Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act (PAHPRA) (PDF - 284 KB). Influenza Vaccine Development Programs BARDA supports a number of core services to assist the production of required products, in a manner that is timely, reliable and cost effective. Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile Program BARDA uses a comprehensive portfolio approach to develop and acquire a broad array of medical countermeasures for pandemic flu, including vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and non-pharmaceutical countermeasures and to build and sustain their domestic manufacturing infrastructure. Influenza Diagnostics Program Congress seeks to improve our Nation's emergency preparedness with Project BioShield, which provides the government with the ability to develop, acquire, stockpile, and make available the medical countermeasures needed to protect the U.S. population against a public health threat. Influenza Therapeutics Program A primary goal of the program is to establish national stockpiles of FDA-approved antivirals to ensure treatment of influenza-infected persons during an influenza pandemic. Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Infrastructure BARDA's Strategic Science and Technology Division helps bring innovation to our programs. The innovation programs identify and support the advancement of platform technologies that enhance capabilities for the development and manufacturing of medical countermeasures that focus on biodefense, pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases. International Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Capacity Building Program Congress seeks to improve our Nation's emergency preparedness with Project BioShield, which provides the government with the ability to develop, acquire, stockpile, and make available the medical countermeasures needed to protect the U.S. population against a public health threat. BARDA uses a comprehensive portfolio approach to develop and acquire a broad array of medical countermeasures for pandemic flu. This includes developing vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and non-pharmaceutical countermeasures for influenza preparedness and building and sustaining facilities for their domestic manufacturing infrastructure. Advanced Development Milestones and Stockpiling for Influenza Influenza Antivirals, Diagnostics and Devices Pandemic Influenza Spending Reports Influenza Vaccines Vaccines offer pre-exposure protection to individuals who are at risk for contracting influenza. The effective use of vaccines is a key tool for preventing a pandemic or limiting its spread. Under the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan (November 2005), the Department's key goals for vaccine preparedness are: Develop sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to produce pandemic vaccine for the entire U.S. population within six months of pandemic onset. Stockpile vaccines against influenza viruses with pandemic potential to cover 20 million persons. BARDA's planning efforts support the advanced development of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines toward U.S. licensure. Targeted vaccines include (1) cell-based vaccines, (2) antigen-sparing adjuvanted vaccines, which are designed to conserve antigens by mixing in vaccine-boosting compounds known as adjuvants, and (3) next-generation recombinant vaccines. To establish domestic pre-pandemic influenza vaccine stockpiles, BARDA has supported the development and manufacture of vaccines against different H5N1 virus clades (families of closely related strain variants). BARDA supports the secure year-round supply of raw materials including eggs for domestic manufacturing of seasonal and novel influenza vaccines and the development and manufacturing of novel influenza vaccine candidates for clinical evaluation. BARDA also provides cost-sharing support to expand the domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing infrastructure by retrofitting existing vaccine manufacturing facilities and building new cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing facilities. Following the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Secretary Sebelius released the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review: Transforming the Enterprise to Meet Long-Range National Needs (2010), which was made available concurrent to the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology's Report to the President on Reengineering the Influenza Vaccine Production Enterprise to Meet the Challenges of the Pandemic Influenza. Both emphasize the need for technologies to make more vaccine available, faster, to improve our pandemic response capabilities. To address these recommendations, HHS has a number of initiatives underway in the form of collaborations among BARDA, CDC, NIH, FDA and industry partners. H1N1 2009 PANDEMIC RESPONSE In the spring of 2009, a H1N1 influenza virus emerged as a novel virus with pandemic potential. The virus's genes were a combination of genes most closely related to North American swine-lineage H1N1 and Eurasian lineage swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses. This strain had genetically acquired the ability to cross hosts from swine to humans and had the capability of human-to-human transmission. Studies undertaken by health agencies determined that seasonal influenza vaccine provided no protection against this strain of 2009-H1N1 influenza A. Amid outbreaks of disease in Mexico and the U.S., the Acting HHS Secretary declared a public heath emergency on April 26, 2009. BARDA Response Activities: In May 2009, BARDA issued new orders to produce a bulk supply of vaccine antigen and adjuvant and to produce pilot (also called investigational) lots of a 2009 H1N1 vaccine. When the 2009 H1N1 strain was isolated and identified as a novel influenza virus, work began to prepare a virus reference strain and the development of a vaccine candidate virus for distribution to manufacturers domestically and internationally. Standard practice when new influenza strains are discovered include the mixing of clinical sample of the virus with another influenza virus that grows in eggs to develop a new virus that has some of the properties of the novel virus and the ability to grow in eggs to produce the vaccine. Conventional methods of production have depended on this egg-based technology that has been in use since the 1950s for the production of influenza vaccines. Although generally reliable, this particular viral strain did not grow well in egg-based systems at first, resulting in a delay for first available vaccine. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic tested our nation's preparedness against an emerging virus and our ability to respond and adapt to a large-scale, public health emergency with the potential for enormous health consequences. On the whole, the response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was successful. Notable successes include: the rapid identification and characterization of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus; the development and production of a 2009 H1N1 vaccine in record time; the efficient distribution of antiviral medications from the SNS to the states; the use of Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to increase the availability of antiviral medications and speed the availability of diagnostics, including the first EUA for an investigational medical countermeasure; the development and rapid updating of clinical guidance on the treatment of 2009 H1N1; the effective communication with the public regarding methods to prevent transmission of the influenza virus. Although all of these activities demonstrated that our preparedness for an influenza pandemic had key processes and protocols in place, opportunities for improvement were identified in a number of areas to ensure preparedness from a future pandemic or other public health emergency. Key examples are modernizing vaccine development technologies, developing advanced diagnostics for detection and surveillance, improving modeling efforts, and developing mechanisms for accelerated regulatory review and approval of safe and effective vaccines.

DHS has issued a material threat determination covering nerve agents and cyanide chemical threats included in their Terrorism Risk Assessment. BARDA’s Chemical Medical Countermeasures (MCM) Program supports advanced development of MCM candidates and interventions to address these high priority chemical threats. The Chemical MCM Program focuses on advanced development of decontamination treatments for mass exposure, post-exposure antidotes and non-pharmaceutical interventions for chemical exposure, including novel and repurposed therapeutics. A major area of emphasis is development of scientifically-valid guidance suitable for first-responders working on mass casualty decontamination after a chemical event. Decontamination quickly reduces chemical exposure levels and absorbed doses, and also protects responders, medical providers and medical facilities to secondary exposure and contamination. A second emphasis area is the repurposing, or label expansion, of drugs already in common use in hospitals and the community. Repurposing drugs to make them available where and when they are needed in a chemical event will reduce our reliance on centralized stockpiles or logistically-challenging forward deployment programs. A major accomplishment of the Chemical MCM program was the acquisition under Project BioShield in 2013 of midazolam (an anti-convulsive drug) to replace diazepam in the CDC’s CHEMPACK program, which strategically stores nerve agent antidotes in U.S. localities that can be accessed quickly in response to chemical events. BARDA is supporting FDA approval of midazolam for use in the pediatric population and the procurement of pediatric-dose auto-injectors. Delivering these MCMs to the Strategic National Stockpile by 2018 will significantly enhance CHEMPACK capabilities for responding to children during chemical events. BARDA-supported FDA approval of intramuscular midazolam for emergency treatment of prolonged seizures in children and adults will ensure that this vital MCM is widely available to first-responders even when a CHEMPACK is not readily accessible. A second major accomplishment was the publication of decontamination guidance on Primary Response Incident Scene Management (PRISM). Decontamination of individuals exposed to chemical agents is the single most effective way to decrease the negative health impacts of exposure to chemical agents. In addition to midazolam, BARDA is supporting advanced development of six (6) chemical MCM candidates, including repurposed therapeutics (such as Silverlon® burn dressing) for vesicant-induced skin injuries and ketamine for treating nerve agent-induced seizures. Silverlon®development is a collaborative effort between the Chemical and Burn MCM programs, affording BARDA the opportunity to leverage investments in products that can be used in response to more than one material threat. Further leveraging of investments is being done through collaboration with the new National MCM Response Infrastructure, which is facilitating evaluation of several other commercially available drugs for their ability to effectively mitigate injuries resulting from exposure to chemical agents. BARDA will continue working with PHEMCE partners to transition promising new and repurposed chemical MCM candidates from early to advanced research and development, and from advanced development toward FDA approval and acquisition under Project BioShield. BARDA will expand future efforts to improve health outcomes for all victims of chemical exposure by continuing to enhance response capabilities and standards of care, and by supporting development and procurement of new and better therapeutic interventions. We look forward to receiving new candidates for the Chemical MCM Program—this is a high priority with great interest to BARDA.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/cbrn/anthrax/",Anthrax,,"Skip to main content U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Anthrax Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which can cause human disease via gastrointestinal, cutaneous, or inhalational (pulmonary) routes. Although clinical manifestations of the disease differ by route, inhalational anthrax is the most lethal. The threat from a potential antibiotic-resistant strain of B. anthracis is also recognized. On January 20, 2004, the Secretary of Homeland Security determined that anthrax is a material threat to the U.S. population sufficient to affect national security. Anthrax Antitoxins Anthrax Vaccines Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), and Pandemic and All-Hazards Reauthorization Act (2013) (PDF - 284 KB), BARDA’s strategy to support advanced development of critical medical countermeasures targets biothreats that have been determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. The material threat determination for Anthrax was issued in 2005. BARDA supports the Public Health Emergency Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) strategy of having vaccines and antibiotics for post-exposure prophylaxis and anthrax antitoxins in combination with antibiotics for the treatment of individuals who are symptomatic with inhalational anthrax disease. These anthrax antitoxin products were developed to address a gap in preparedness observed during the Amerithrax Attacks in 2001, when 50 percent of individuals with anthrax disease died despite treatment with antibiotics. A robust stockpile of complimentary antibiotics, vaccines and antitoxins was developed to prepare the U.S. government to appropriately respond to an anthrax attack in the event that antibiotics are unavailable or obsolete. BARDA has supported the advanced development of six (6) antitoxin product candidates, both monoclonal and polyclonal. This support led to two (2) products being FDA-approved and procured under Project BioShield (PBS), making this the most advanced portfolio of candidates supported by BARDA’s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Division. Raxibacumab®, a monoclonal candidate manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), was the first novel product to be approved (2012) under the FDA’s Animal Rule and the first product supported under PBS to achieve that milestone. A polyclonal product manufactured by Emergent/Cangene (anthrax immunoglobulin AIG, Anthrasil®) was licensed by the FDA in 2015, becoming the second anthrax antitoxin candidate and the third product supported under PBS to achieve licensure. Under PBS, BARDA funded the advanced development of both products toward FDA approval. BARDA has purchased, delivered and maintained these anthrax antitoxins in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to treat symptomatic individuals in the event of an anthrax incident. BARDA also has provided PBS funds to collect additional human plasma to be manufactured into Anthrasil®final product in the future, as product currently in the SNS expires. A third candidate, ETI-204 or Anthim (developed by Elusys) represents a second monoclonal in the BARDA Anthrax portfolio. Anthim was FDA approved in March 2016. With submission of the BLA, the project will soon transition to potential procurement under PBS. Inclusion of this candidate in the SNS will provide a second monoclonal product and a total of three (3) anthrax antitoxin products to address the need for treatment of symptomatic individuals. The ETI-204 candidate highlights the PHEMCE model of transitioning programs from early research and development at NIH to BARDA for advanced development and potential procurement under PBS, followed by maintenance by the SNS. The accomplishments of the Anthrax Antitoxins program have increased our preparedness to treat individuals with inhalational anthrax disease. Future goals for this program include transitioning from late stage development and procurement to sustaining preparedness levels and supporting Phase 4 post-marketing commitments and requirements under FDA licensure. Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), and Pandemic and All-Hazards Reauthorization Act (2013) (PDF - 284 KB), BARDA’s strategy to support advanced development of critical medical countermeasures targets biothreats that have been determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. An integral part of BARDA’s anthrax medical countermeasures (MCM) portfolio, the Anthrax Vaccines Program supports the PHEMCE strategy of having a compliment of antibiotics, vaccines and antitoxins that enable the U.S. Government to respond appropriately to an anthrax attack. When used in combination with antibiotics, anthrax vaccines can be administered in a post-exposure setting to those individuals at high risk or suspected exposure. The Anthrax Vaccines Program’s goal is one part of BARDA’s over-arching strategy to support advanced development of vaccines and antibiotics for post-exposure prophylaxis and anthrax antitoxins for the treatment of individuals who are symptomatic with anthrax disease. Specific goals of the anthrax vaccine program are to improve the utility of the currently-licensed anthrax vaccine (BioThrax®), to enhance the currently-licensed vaccine’s capability through development of an adjuvanted formulation, and to support the development of next-generation anthrax vaccine candidates that may further improve U.S. Government response capabilities against anthrax. BARDA’s near-term strategy for anthrax vaccines leverages funding to support improvements in the utility and capability of BioThrax®. Significant progress toward this goal includes delivery of BioThrax® to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) under PBS funding and submission in late 2014 of the Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) indication, with anticipated FDA licensure in 2015. Projects are ongoing to expand the vaccine’s label indication for post-exposure prophylaxis, increase the current U.S. manufacturing production capacity and support the development of an enhanced vaccine formulation candidate with adjuvant (NuThrax®) that may produce a more rapid immune response with fewer doses required for protection. NuThrax® will enter Phase 3 clinical development in 2015 and potentially transition to procurement under PBS later in the decade. Successful execution of this near-term strategy may have a significant impact on U.S. preparedness against an anthrax attack and provide a substantial reduction in costs across the PHEMCE. BARDA’s long-term anthrax vaccine strategy supports the advanced development of next-generation anthrax vaccine candidates that may further reduce the number of doses required for protection, improve response concept of operations with a thermostable vaccine in the field, and lower overall costs of stockpiling vaccine with longer shelf life and easier cold storage. Since 2006, BARDA has supported the advanced development of five (5) next-generation vaccine candidates, including recombinant protective antigen (rPA) and adenovirus-vectored vaccines. Three (3) next-generation candidates remain in the anthrax portfolio and soon will be evaluated in clinical trials for safety and immunogenicity to determine their potential as long-term replacement vaccines for the SNS. BARDA will manage its long-term anthrax vaccine development portfolio proactively through data-driven down selection of candidate vaccines that do not represent a transformative improvement in preparedness over existing stockpiled vaccine(s). This strategy will ensure wise use of limited resources and optimize the Nation's capability for responding to an anthrax attack. BARDA continues to coordinate with its PHEMCE partners to develop and procure robust and complementary medical countermeasure armamentaria necessary to respond to an anthrax event, including vaccines, therapeutics and antibiotics for the general and special populations.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/newsroom/2021/ventures/","News release from HHS.gov: HHS launches first venture capital partnership to develop transformative technologies to combat future pandemics, other health emergencies","Global Health Investment Corporation selected for partnership.","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA News release from HHS.gov: HHS launches first venture capital partnership to develop transformative technologies to combat future pandemics, other health emergencies WEB ANNOUNCEMENT Share The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today unveiled a new type of public-private partnership that enables investments using venture capital practices. Through the BARDA Ventures program, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, is launching a partnership with the nonprofit organization Global Health Investment Corporation (GHIC) to accelerate development and commercialization of technologies and medical products needed to respond to or prevent public health emergencies, such as pandemics, and other health security threats. Through this partnership, BARDA intends to provide GHIC with a minimum of $50 million over five years with potential for up to $500 million over 10 years. GHIC will launch a global health security fund with matching capital from other investors. This partnership will allow direct linkage with the investment community and establish sustained and long- term efforts to identify, nurture, and commercialize technologies that aid the U.S. in responding effectively to future health security threats. “While we tackle the pandemic’s impact, we’re exploring how the U.S. can better prepare for future public health emergencies, whether it’s the next pandemic or a bioterrorism incident,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The pandemic has demonstrated that the U.S. needs transformative technology that is not only available but also widely accessible. Today we are announcing an innovative, cost-effective approach that puts us on a better path to take on the next public health crisis and improve U.S. health care.” With BARDA Ventures funding, GHIC plans to provide investment to companies developing breakthrough technologies. GHIC will collaborate with companies from around the world to source promising products with the potential to strengthen health security and generate financial returns. GHIC will structure investments with co-funding from additional private investors. As the technologies and companies generate investment returns, proceeds from BARDA Ventures funding will be returned to GHIC for reinvestment and sustainment of BARDA Ventures. “Pathogens and health security threats constantly evolve and change. To effectively combat them, we need new and innovative ways to tap into the most novel and impactful ideas in the entrepreneurial community,” said BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “BARDA Ventures will rise to the challenge by engaging that community and leveraging both public and private funds to change the way we prepare for health security threats of the future.” To establish the BARDA Ventures partnership model, BARDA drew on responses to two public requests for information and hundreds of discussions with venture capital experts in the government and private sector. In 2020, BARDA announced the need for a nonprofit partnership manager. GHIC was selected as that partner with a demonstrated track record of successful venture capital investments in healthcare and life science. Through its Global Health Investment Fund, GHIC provides global health impact investing. GHIC has accelerated the development and delivery of more than a dozen innovative products that address global health and pandemic threats, including diagnostics, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other medical products. These products have reached more than 100 million patients to support health while generating returns on invested capital. In establishing the program, BARDA leveraged its deep experience with wide-ranging public-private partnerships with companies of all sizes and experience levels, from global pharmaceutical conglomerates to small business startups, in developing lifesaving medical countermeasures. Collaborations have varied from cost-sharing contracts to flexible agreements under Other Transaction Authority. This experience includes the founding of an accelerator partnership to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria, called CARB-X, in 2016 with the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust. CARB-X is managed by Boston University and is now the world’s largest public-private partnership dedicated to accelerating new countermeasures to combat antimicrobial resistant infections. The BARDA Ventures partnership with GHIC will be supported through BARDA’s Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe). BARDA launched DRIVe in 2018 to focus on potentially breakthrough technologies and capabilities needed to address systemic challenges across all health security threats, such as sensor and artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies to provide early and actionable health information, solutions for detecting and preventing sepsis, alternative vaccine delivery technologies, biologics and small molecule drug repurposing to combat threats. BARDA’s DRIVe currently is partnering with 37 companies and has a network of 13 accelerators in different regions of the country to better source innovation across the world. The accelerator network supports early-stage companies throughout their journey – from identifying a need to product launch – to help them overcome their biggest business and operational hurdles, and achieve success sooner. Through its accelerator network, DRIVe is providing 154 health security product developers with this wrap-around support. With the BARDA Ventures partnership, BARDA looks to expand that impact even further. “BARDA Ventures is part of the comprehensive system we are creating to better prepare for any novel threat that emerges,” said BARDA DRIVe Director Sandeep Patel, Ph.D. “DRIVe has demonstrated a track record of successful engagements with the entrepreneur and research communities, and this program engages them further to make an immediate impact on global health security.” Want to learn more about BARDA Ventures?

The investigational therapeutic is a promising first-in-class fusion protein and immune modulator. Immune modulators have the potential to minimize the damaging effects of an overactive immune response to COVID-19. This overactive response can contribute to the severity of the illness. “Our agreement with Merck is the latest example of how industry and government are coming together under Operation Warp Speed to move potential therapeutics all the way from development through to manufacturing, enabling faster distribution,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “More good news about COVID-19 therapeutics is constantly emerging, and President Trump’s commitment to supporting lifesaving therapeutics has already helped deliver hundreds of thousands of Operation Warp Speed-supported therapeutics to the frontlines.” The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command, to provide approximately $356 million to Merck. This funding allows for development of MK-7110, including completing activities required to request Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and for delivery of up to 100,000 doses of MK-7110 by June 30, 2021. With this approach, doses will be packaged and ready to ship in the first half of 2021, in the event FDA determines MK-7110 meets the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The federal government would allocate these doses to treat severe and critical COVID-19 patients using the same approach that has been used successfully to allocate limited supplies of other COVID-19 therapeutic treatments. The doses will be made available to the American public at no cost however, there may be costs associated with hospitalization. Interim analysis of a Phase 3 clinical trial in September 2020 indicated that patients who received a single dose of the therapeutic had a 60 percent greater chance of clinical recovery than those who received a placebo. Preliminary analysis also showed that the treatment potentially reduces the risk of respiratory failure or death by 50 percent compared to the standard of care. The study is still ongoing.

From investing in early innovation, to late stage development through U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, with each partnership, BARDA focuses on the end goal: ensuring products are available for the American people and the global community to protect health and save lives from a national security threat or other public health emergency. FDA approval, licensure, and clearance for medical countermeasures is a critical milestone for our partners and for BARDA and demonstrates the success of public-private partnerships in mitigating threats and creating a return on the public investment. That’s why we celebrate every FDA approval, licensure or clearance of a medical countermeasure. At BARDA, we are excited about the news of the recent FDA approval of an Ebola treatment, EbangaTM (ansuvimab-zykl, formerly known as mAb114), from our partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, LP. The treatment is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies bind to a virus protein, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. BARDA and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics partnered in September 2019 for activities required to apply for FDA approval, including late-stage manufacturing of the therapeutic. The success of the program demonstrates the integrated government interagency effort to drive medical countermeasures from bench to bedside. - Early Investment: Scientists from the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, discovered, isolated the antibody from a survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in collaboration with the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale, the Institute for Research in Biomedicine, and the U.S. Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and advanced the product through early clinical development. - Interagency Clinical Development: The investigational treatment initially was manufactured by the VRC with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).], and additional clinical grade production was conducted at NIAID facilities. The product was developed into a powder formulation that did not require freezer storage, which is helpful in natural outbreak settings where freezer storage is sometimes unreliable. The product can be reconstituted onsite at Ebola treatment centers. The product was made available to Ebola patients in the DRC under an expanded access protocol led by the World Health Organization in a trial co-sponsored by NIAID and the National Biomedical Research Institute in the DRC. In addition, this product was evaluated in the NIAID-sponsored Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM) study. The PALM study compared the efficacy of three investigational products, including Ebanga , against a control arm of patients receiving an antibody cocktail. Patients treated with Ebanga had improved outcomes over those in the control arm. The product received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which helped facilitate development toward approval by the FDA. - Development and Clinical Testing: NIAID VRC conducted the Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers at the NIH Clinical Center. Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, a majority woman-owned business founded in 2014, licensed Ebanga from NIAID and was responsible for leading the development, clinical testing and ultimate FDA licensure of the treatment. Ridgeback and BARDA partnered in September 2019 for late-stage manufacturing and regulatory activities to support licensure. From the isolation of the antibody by government scientists to the ultimate 2020 FDA approval of the second Ebola therapeutic by a private sector partner, we are honored to be a part of this endeavor which helps make the world a healthier, safer place. For us, number 57 illustrates what government and industry can accomplish together. With novel medicines, diagnostics and vaccines we can save lives, protect the American people and enhance global health security. Visit our new FDA Approval Page to learn more about our support aiding our partners in achieving the other 56 approvals. While obtaining FDA approval is a major milestone and symbol of development success, regulatory approval is not the end game for those of us in public health preparedness and response. Making sure those products are available when they’re needed is the real end game. Each approval offers an opportunity to recognize the collective and collaborative work of the scientific community, government partners and our industry partners to enhance national health security. Approval number 57 highlights just that, 25 years of public and private partnerships to counter Ebola. ...AND WE HAVE MORE IN THE PIPELINEExplore BARDA's rapidly expanding COVID-19 medical countermeasure portfolio to learn about other exciting products in the pipeline.

Rapid, accurate diagnostic tests can facilitate early warning, outbreak control and targeted antiviral drug therapy for infected patients. During seasonal epidemics, rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for influenza viruses allow healthcare providers to initiate earlier antiviral therapy, limit additional diagnostic testing, and potentially reduce antibiotic use. Rapid, accurate tests that enable early recognition of a novel influenza virus can guide clinical/public health interventions and help monitor the spread of influenza within communities. BARDA's Influenza Diagnostics Program's goal are to build preparedness for pandemic influenza with fast, simple and accurate influenza diagnostic tests that also support rapid treatment and control of seasonal influenza in community settings, and to provide more and better information on antiviral drug usage. BARDA's Influenza Diagnostics Program (in partnership with CDC's Influenza Division) has supported a number of successful projects since 2007. One major accomplishment made possible with BARDA support was the development of the 3M/Focus diagnostic product, Aura®, that rapidly detects influenza A, B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Aura® received FDA-clearance in 2012 and had been adopted into clinical diagnostic practice. BARDA support also led to four (4) new rapid influenza tests that were CLIA-waived from 2011-2013 and can now be used simply and accurately to diagnose viral infection at or near the site of patient care. Emergency Use Authorizationss were issued for two (2) BARDA-funded diagnostic products to detect H1N1 influenza virus during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Three (3) of these products subsequently were FDA-cleared, providing increased diagnostic capability in clinical labs. BARDA also increased domestic influenza diagnostic capacity by supporting the development of an investigational product that facilitated recognition of the first pandemic H1N1 2009 case in the U.S., and the upgrading of public health labs with instrumentation needed for high throughput diagnostic testing at the onset of the 2009 pandemic. BARDA currently supports advanced development of three (3) product candidates to improve influenza diagnostic capability and capacity: an antiviral resistance test by Becton Dickinson, a genotyping microarray by InDevR Inc., and a low-cost, rapid test by Alere, Inc. BARDA also is supporting a Johns Hopkins University study to demonstrate the implementation of rapid diagnostic test systems with best practice advisories (electronic prompts) in emergency departments and the impact of these systems on antiviral drug usage. Preliminary results from the JHU study show that having rapid diagnostics available increased influenza antiviral drug prescriptions by more two-and-a-half (2.5) fold. Further studies may provide additional evidence to promote clinical- and cost-effectiveness, in support of an ultimate goal to improve antiviral drug use and health outcomes. Future BARDA work will focus on developing capability to recognize potential pandemic influenza viruses in point-of-care settings, speeding influenza diagnosis to prompt early antiviral use and addressing restrictive outpatient reimbursement by healthcare providers. BARDA also plans to support advanced development of new nucleotide sequencing technologies and prodromal or pre-symptomatic biomarkers for influenza. By continuing to widen availability of enhanced influenza diagnostic tools, BARDA will promote effective, timely management and treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza, and reduce impact on health, communities, and the Nation.

Under the flexible agreement, the government now can purchase more than 2 million additional treatment courses if needed, in addition to previous commitment to purchase 950,000 treatment courses. The contract modification ensures the therapeutic is not considered a scarce resource. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab on Nov. 9. Healthcare providers administer the therapeutic through IV infusion to non-hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms and are at high-risk for severe symptoms and hospitalization. Lilly developed bamlanivimab without federal support. The monoclonal antibody that comprises the therapeutic was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, which mimic the human immune response, are produced outside of the body by a single clone of cells or a cell line with identical antibody molecules and then delivered to patients by infusion. The antibodies bind to certain proteins of a virus, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. Share Last Updated: January 13, 2021 Share this article now!

As rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pathogens continue to increase new therapeutics and vaccines are essential to combat the growing crisis. The Situation Every year, 2.8 million American develop a drug resistant infection and 35,000 people die. Globally, MDR infections kill 700,000 each year - current estimates are that MDR organisms will kill more than 10 million a year by 2050 if left unchecked. Your browser does not support the HTML5 Video element. BARDA's Impact BARDA supports development and procurement of medical countermeasures to protect Americans against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. MDR does not discriminate, and victims of CBRN events are at risk of suffering fatal complications from drug resistant infections. One of BARDA’s top priorities is to develop a vaccine to protect people from these threats. TWO WAYS BARDA CAN HELP YOU ON YOUR ANTIBACTERIAL VACCINE CANDIDATE The BARDA Antibacterials program is well known for investments in small molecules since its launch in 2010, including supporting FDA approval of three antibiotics. But BARDA’s investments go beyond antibiotics. The BARDA CBRN Vaccine program has invested in efforts that led to FDA licensure of vaccines against smallpox and Ebola. And through CARB-X, the portfolio has expanded to include non-traditional products and currently supports the development of four vaccines. Vaccines against MDR Threats-BARDA BAA Through the existing BAA (BAA-18-100-SOL-00003), BARDA is looking to support programs for vaccines for MDR pathogens in the late preclinical stage through phase II clinical development. Learn more or apply BARDA partners with CARB-X for support of preclinical development of vaccines for MDR/DR pathogens. CARB-X is a global non-profit partnership dedicated to accelerating antibacterial research to tackle the global rising threat of drug-resistant bacteria.

Among other barriers, the analysis revealed that current vaccine manufacturers lacked the capacity to rapidly fill vaccine vials and finish packaging vaccine in sufficient quantities for the nation. The review recommended creating a network of existing, pre-qualified facilities that could fill and finish the vaccine for manufacturers in a public health emergency. The nation's pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity grew in 2012 when HHS established three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADMs) to develop and manufacture medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and medicines used to protect health in emergencies. Among other capabilities, the CIADMs are designed to be able to manufacture 150 million doses of vaccine within 12 weeks of the declaration of a pandemic, supplementing our existing influenza manufacturing capacity. The FFMN similarly supports the increase in our existing influenza manufacturing capacity. On September 27, 2013, the 4 FFMN original contracts were awarded to Cook Pharmica (Bloomington, IN), Patheon Pharmaceuticals (Greenville, NC), Par Pharmaceuticals (Rochester, MI) and Nanotherapeutics (Alachua, FL). In September 2016, two additional contracts were awarded to companies that can also provide cores services as well as specifically provide Live Virus Vectored (LVV) fill and finish services: Advanced BioSciences Laboratories, Inc. (ABL) (Rockville, MD) and IDT Biologika Corporation (Rockville, MD). Today's enhanced Fill and Finish Manufacturing Network will complement the CIADMs and manufacturers, and support the availability of an additional 117 million doses of influenza vaccine in the event of a pandemic. Additionally, as a component of the National Medical Countermeasure Response Infrastructure, the network is fully prepared to support any response efforts against future emerging infectious diseases or other public health emergencies. The expanded fill and finish manufacturing network also could provide core services for drugs and vaccines used to protect health in emergencies caused by chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

People infected with SARS-CoV-2 and similar respiratory viruses typically only seek diagnostic tests after exhibiting symptoms. Sonica Health aims to disrupt this healthcare paradigm by detecting infection, especially in high-risk individuals, before the onset of noticeable symptoms, thereby reducing infection transmission. In conjunction with Northwestern University and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab researchers, the team is creating and implementing a set of symptom-driven algorithms specifically tailored to catch early signs and symptoms associated with COVID-19 and to monitor patients throughout illness. Custom signal processing and machine-learning can reveal subtle, yet critical insight into health status using the continuous streams of data collected and wirelessly transmitted to a data hub. In addition, Sonica Health is working with Sibel Health to offer additional continuous pulse oximetry in one integrated digital health system. Sonica Health is utilizing a bio-integrated, wearable patch called ADAM. The flexible wireless patch is a thin device about the size of a band-aid and sits at the base of the throat. The device monitors cough intensity and patterns; chest wall movements which can indicate labored or irregular breathing; other respiratory sounds; heart rate; physical activity; and temperature. Sonica Health will now expand this platform to include the option to deploy Sibel Health’s ANNETM One platform—this ICU-grade wearable sensor system offers the ability to add continuous pulse oximetry and electrocardiography. In a team effort, Sonica will be conducting clinical studies among healthcare providers using these breakthrough, soft, and flexible sensors with the goal of developing infection detection algorithms for COVID-19. The overall goal is an FDA-cleared platform encompassing the sensors, algorithm, and software package as an early warning system for SARS-CoV-2 contraction, and prognosis, helping reduce the transmission of the infection through early detection.

Chemical exposures, whether caused by an intentional or accidental chemical release, can occur without warning, and injury or death often occur shortly after exposure. The rapid availability of effective MCMs against chemical threats is critical in the treatment of their acute health effects following exposures. The new ReDIRECT Program is a collaborative effort between BARDA’s Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) and the Chemical MCM Branch in BARDA’s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Division which aims to identify existing, commonly available MCMs that can be used to save lives during a chemical emergency. Under this new EZ BAA Area of Interest (AOI), BARDA will review concise abstract submissions for funding development that repurposes easily accessible therapeutics as MCMs against threats such as chlorine gas, opioids, nerve agents, and others. To learn more, please visit https://drive.hhs.gov/ReDIRECT.html. The EZ-BAA was created to provide a streamlined process through which BARDA, and DRIVe specifically, can review and accept applications for development funding of transformative products and technologies to protect Americans from health security threats. The application process is both business-friendly and easy to follow. Since its inception, DRIVe's EZ-BAA solicitation has averaged more than one abstract submission per day while active, with awards of up to $750,000 made in as few as 30 days. The EZ-BAA has helped transform BARDA’s contracting process and provide innovators, entrepreneurs, and organizations with a simplified and rapid mechanism to partner with the BARDA.

This latest purchase brings the total to 950,000 treatment courses.","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA News release from HHS.gov: Trump Administration purchases additional doses of Lilly therapeutic to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 WEB ANNOUNCEMENT Share The Trump Administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD), today announced the purchase of 650,000 additional treatments courses of Eli Lilly and Company’s investigational monoclonal antibody therapeutic, bamlanivimab, to be delivered in December and January for treatment of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This latest purchase brings the total to 950,000 treatment courses. Each treatment course is a single dose. Under the agreement announced October 28 and to meet Operation Warp Speed goals, the company is in the process of delivering the first 300,000 doses, and on November 10, HHS began allocating these doses to state and territorial health departments which, in turn, are determining which healthcare facilities receive the infusion drug. “With COVID-19 cases on the rise, treating people with mild or moderate infections can help prevent hospitalizations, which will reduce that burden on healthcare systems,” said HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Robert Kadlec, MD. “To ensure equitable and efficient distribution, we will continue coordinating with Lilly, its distributor, and state and territorial health departments to get these additional therapeutics into the hands of healthcare providers quickly, with a focus on areas of the country currently hardest hit by the pandemic.” A data-driven system is ensuring fair and equitable distribution of these new products. Weekly allocations to state and territorial health departments are based proportionally on confirmed COVID-19 cases in each state and territory over the previous seven days, based on data hospitals and state health departments enter into the HHS Protect data collection platform. To date, more than 215,000 treatment courses of bamlanivimab have been allocated. The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) worked with state and territory partners to refine the process based on experience with previous therapeutics and diagnostics; shipments now occur within hours of pulling the weekly data. These government-purchased doses are available at no cost to patients, although healthcare facilities could charge for administering the medicine – as is customary with such government-purchased products. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of ASPR, funded the purchase of the product working in collaboration with the DOD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and the Army Contracting Command. Lilly received emergency use authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration November 9 for use in treating non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate confirmed cases of COVID-19. Under the EUA, bamlanivimab may only be administered in settings in which health care providers have immediate access to medications to treat a severe infusion reaction, such as anaphylaxis, and the ability to activate the emergency medical system (EMS), as necessary. Facilities also must have space available to administer the medication in a manner that minimizes infection transmission. The company developed the medicine without federal support. Bamlanivimab currently is being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials funded by Lilly in addition to a clinical trial as part of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership led by the National Institutes of Health with funding and other support from the BARDA. ACTIV is part of a coordinated research strategy to prioritize and speed development of the most promising treatments and vaccines. To find out how much bamlanivimab has been allocated to specific states, territories, and jurisdictions, visit the allocation dashboard. This dashboard will be updated each distribution week until the FDA issues a revised EUA indicating the U.S. government involvement in the allocation and distribution process is no longer needed. This may occur when the supply of the product meets the demand from the commercial marketplace.

The task order is worth up to $628 million and falls under an existing contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of HHS’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Under the task order, Emergent will commit manufacturing capacity valued at up to $542.75 million for production of COVID-19 vaccine candidates through 2021, in addition to an investment of approximately $85.5 million for the rapid expansion of Emergent’s vial-filling its contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) capacity for vaccines and therapeutics. Before this task order announcement, Emergent had begun collaborating on manufacturing with Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, and Vaxart on their COVID-19 vaccine candidates. (Johnson & Johnson’s candidate has received BARDA support). BARDA has invested since 2012 to expand domestic manufacturing capabilities in the United States, including creating three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing; one of the centers is managed by Emergent and becomes the first to be deployed for the Operation Warp Speed effort. HHS Secretary Alex Azar issued the following statement: “Within two weeks after announcing Operation Warp Speed, President Trump has now brought on another key manufacturing partner for an eventual COVID-19 vaccine. Before a vaccine is even approved, Emergent’s manufacturing capabilities will pave the way for drug companies with candidates approaching approval to begin turning out doses.

This will be the first time HHS has utilized VC practices to make investments. As part of the new program, BARDA is soliciting proposals for an existing nonprofit partner to manage an investment fund that will support breakthrough technologies and create entirely new approaches to enhance U.S. preparedness and response to 21st century health security threats, including COVID-19 and future pandemics. Over the past 14 years, BARDA has created strong and impactful public-private partnerships with companies large and small in the life sciences, biotech and pharmaceutical industries. BARDA now is extending this approach to include partnerships with the private investment community. BARDA Ventures, through the nonprofit partner, will establish a long-term health security fund to ensure sustained investments in disruptive technologies can better prepare the nation for any health security threat. Through this new program, BARDA seeks to build a capability to better utilize venture capital practices to stimulate innovation and promote disruptive technologies aimed at addressing gaps in pandemic response and healthcare preparedness. Historically, the investment community has been known for quickly identifying promising technologies and bringing them to market. Utilizing these approaches will help support the current pandemic response and prepare for the next one. As part of the recently announced agreement, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will be a key collaborator on BARDA Ventures. DFC has authority under the Defense Production Act and a mandate to help re-shore domestic production of strategic resources needed for the COVID-19 response. DFC will provide subject matter expertise to help advise the BARDA Ventures program, and will potentially offer additional financing options to BARDA Ventures-backed companies, subject to receiving a qualifying application. The BARDA mission covers seven areas across the continuum of response to public health emergencies, such as pandemics, as well as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents. The pipeline of mission-congruent technologies can include those that: - detect, recognize, and report on potential agents and threats in as close to real time as possible; - identify and characterize known and unknown human disease threats rapidly - prevent or reduce the spread of disease and illnesses caused by health security threats; - implement evaluation methods to increase the speed of validation and demonstrating effectiveness and safety of technologies - develop transformative methods, processes, and capacity to overcome constraints in the manufacturing of products; - enhance ways to manage the supply chain and distribute health products quickly and widely to reach all communities across the United States in response to threats; and - improve the delivery and administration of pharmaceutical products to individuals in need. While BARDA continues to invest in solutions to these problems through our broad agency announcement and EZ-BAA in non-dilutive ways, BARDA Ventures will address gaps that exist in the response continuum, particularly technologies and approaches that could enhance the nation’s ability to prepare and respond to health security threats. Responses to the solicitation are due by 12/8/2020 at 12:00 PM EST; for details and instructions on submitting proposals, see the BARDA Ventures Website, and visit the solicitation posting on Beta.SAM.gov.

The agreement also allows the U.S. government to acquire an additional 500 million doses.","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA U.S. government engages Pfizer to produce millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine WEB ANNOUNCEMENT Share The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense (DoD) today announced an agreement with U.S.-based Pfizer Inc. for large-scale production and nationwide delivery of 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States following the vaccine’s successful manufacture and approval. The agreement also allows the U.S. government to acquire an additional 500 million doses. The federal government will own the 100 million doses of vaccine initially produced as a result of this agreement, and Pfizer will deliver the doses in the United States if the product receives Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or licensure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as outlined in FDA guidance, after completing demonstration of safety and efficacy in a large Phase 3 clinical trial. By entering into this agreement now, a safe and effective vaccine can be shipped quickly if FDA grants EUA or licensure. This approach helps meet the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed goal to begin delivering 300 million of doses of safe and effective vaccine to the American people by the end of the year. “Through Operation Warp Speed, we are assembling a portfolio of vaccines to increase the odds that the American people will have at least one safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending on success in clinical trials, today’s agreement will enable the delivery of approximately 100 million doses of vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.” The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command, to provide $1.95 billion for the production and nationwide delivery of the first 100 million doses of the vaccine after EUA or licensure, with the ability to acquire up to an additional 500 million doses. Subject to technical success and EUA or licensure, the company would begin nationwide delivery of these vaccine doses to locations at the U.S. government’s direction beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. The vaccine would be available to the American people at no cost. As is customary with government-purchased vaccines, healthcare professionals could charge insurers for the cost of administering the vaccine. Pfizer is collaborating with BioNTech, a German biotechnology company, to develop COVID-19 investigational vaccines without U.S. government financial support. Phase 1/2 clinical trials are underway for the investigational vaccines in the United States and Germany. About Operation Warp Speed (OWS): OWS aims to begin delivery of 300 million doses of an FDA authorized, safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 by the end of the year as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. OWS is a partnership among components of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, engaging with private firms and other federal agencies, and coordinating among existing HHS-wide efforts, including the NIH’s Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) partnership, NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative, and work by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. About HHS, ASPR, and BARDA: HHS works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans, providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/influenza-and-emerging-infectious-diseases/coronavirus/pharmaceutical-manufacturing-in-america/","MedicalCountermeasures.gov",,"Skip to main content U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Pharmaceutical Manufacturing in America BARDA'S COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES Coronavirus Resources: Coronavirus.gov Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) What the U.S. Government is Doing BARDA launched a strategic partnership in May 2020 to foster and expand Pharmaceutical Manufacturing in America by increasing U.S.-based manufacturing capacity to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients and generic medicines needed during the COVID-19 response , and during future public health emergencies. The Challenge Currently, a majority of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their chemical compounds needed for critical medicines are manufactured outside the United States. They are typically manufactured using slow and less efficient processes. Shipping the ingredients or finished drugs to the U.S. wastes valuable time that can slow down our country’s response to a pandemic or other public health emergency. Such global dependencies put our national health supply chain at risk. The U.S. national medical supply also is placed at further risk during a global health emergency when individual countries can close borders and potentially curtail access to these critical materials. The Opportunities With funding provided by congress under “Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020” and “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act’’ (CARES Act’), BARDA was able to invest in and enhance U.S.-based manufacturing capacity. BARDA has made previous investments to expand U.S.-based biological manufacturing capacity by helping private sector partners build or retrofit manufacturing lines, establishing three Centers for Innovation and Advanced Manufacturing (CIADMs), and a Fill Finish Manufacturing Network (FFMN). COVID-19 funding and authorization provides BARDA the resources and opportunity to build on that experience to expand into new public-private partnerships that further increase U.S. based pharmaceutical manufacturing. By partnering with the Phlow-led team, BARDA has initiated a new effort that seeks to increase U.S.based capacity for producing the APIs and the chemical compounds necessary to make critical medicines and help alleviate or prevent drug shortages, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The partnership provides a unique opportunity to develop an end-to-end advanced domestic manufacturing capability to significantly improve our nation’s domestic pharmaceutical supply chain. The Impact In public health emergencies, the “Pharmaceutical Manufacturing in America” strategic effort holds the potential to provide patients in the United States with critical essential medicines faster, reduce the likelihood of drug shortages, and increase U.S. preparedness. How Partners Work Together Phlow AMPAC Fine Chemicals CivicaRx Virginia Commonwealth University X More About Phlow Phlow USA Partner: Phlow was founded as a U.S.-based public benefit company with a mission to provide low-cost, high quality, essential medicines in the United States. As an initiative partner, their goal is to help America secure a strategic stockpile of active ingredients and essential medicines to reduce America’s dependence on foreign sources. X More About AMPAC Fine Chemicals AMPAC Fine Chemicals USA Partner: AMPAC Fine Chemicals (AFC) is a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical and precursor chemical ingredients located in Virginia. Through BARDA’s strategic partnership, Phlow works with AFC as well as other FDA-approved cGMP manufacturers to secure capacity for immediate API production. Phlow also will secure its own API manufacturing capabilities adjacent to AMPAC’s plant in Petersburg, Virginia, to make API. X More About CivicaRx CivicaRx USA Partner: CivicaRx will manufacture the finished dosage forms, including vials and syringes with a network of manufacturing partners that has been built. They also will begin immediate plans to build their own finished dosage form manufacturing facility in a partnership with Phlow Corporation on the same site as Phlow’s operations to ensure an end-to-end domestic capability focused on solving the nation’s critical drug shortage challenges. X More About Virginia Commonwealth University Virginia Commonwealth University Medicines for All Institute (""M4ALL"") USA Partner: Virginia Commonwealth University Medicines for All Institute (“M4ALL”) will use innovative flow chemistry and proprietary process manufacturing technologies to produce API with higher quality, higher yielding, faster and less costly methods as compared to batch manufacturing. They have already proven their ability to do this with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The test is being designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen from nasal swab samples and associated antibodies in 60 seconds or less through a finger-prick. Using the nasal swab antigen test, healthcare providers can triage patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 rapidly and make informed treatment decisions. Furthermore, antibody testing of blood to identify serological antibodies indicates which patients have been previously infected, even without showing symptoms, and recovered or those who could be potentially developing an infection but asymptomatic and need care. The added convenience of this test being Bluetooth-connected to cloud-based data management networks may aid public health officials with real-time geographical mapping of outbreaks. The HEMEMICS HemBox™ biosensor system is a currently under development for a rapid detection, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tool capable of simultaneously testing for up to 17 pathogens, using only one drop of blood or mucous. With results delivered in 60 seconds or less, clinicians could administer testing, diagnosis, and treatment in one patient interaction. HemBox™ is expected to offer an inexpensive, real time, rapidly deployable alternative tool for healthcare providers; the HemBox is being developed to be used easily in both traditional care environments and in the field for swift and accurate diagnosis of known and novel infectious diseases, like SARS-CoV-2.

Known as a serology assay, the test detects the presence of IgG antibodies specific to the virus in a person’s blood. Having certain levels of these immuno-protective antibodies indicates that the person is convalescent (recovering or recovered from COVID-19). This knowledge is particularly important for healthcare providers and workers in essential industries such as utilities and food production and may inform a person’s decision on when to return to work after potential exposure to the virus. This diagnostic test has been designed to respond to the need to identify people in the population who had already been infected with the virus, but whose diagnosis has not been confirmed by performing a swab and a molecular diagnostic test, or who have recovered from recent infection. DiaSorin's assay runs on the company’s FDA 510(k) cleared LIAISON XL instrument platform used routinely in hundreds of hospital and reference diagnostic laboratories across the U.S. The platform fully automates management of the diagnostic process, allowing laboratories to process up to 170 patient blood samples per hour, with a minimum level of intervention required by laboratory operators and results in less than 45 minutes. This availability and speed increases the current capacity for testing to detect past infections in people who are recovering or recovered from COVID-19. The system is a fully automated, easy to use, quantitative detection platform that performs a range of immunodiagnostic assays. The platform consists of the automated LIAISON instrument and an immunodiagnostics assay workflow. This serological test is the second DiaSorin COVID-19 test to be supported by BARDA; the first was the SimplexaTM COVID-19 Direct assay, a molecular test for qualitative identification of SARS-CoV-2 which was developed by subsidiary, DiaSorin Molecular, LLC, of Cypress, California.

Currently there are no SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests based on oral fluids available for high-throughput ELISA screening. Although the test could be used at point of care facilities such as doctors’ offices, clinics, or hospitals, the goal is to have patients collect their own saliva samples at home to maintain social distancing and then ship their sample to the lab. Oral fluid collection is non-invasive and requires less human contact in comparison to blood draw. At-home self-collection also minimizes health care workers’ exposure to potentially infected patients and permits a large number of individuals to be screened quickly. OraSure plans to leverage the 510(k) cleared Drugs of Abuse (DOA) ELISA platform as the starting point to develop this ELISA-based coronavirus antibody test. The test is being designed to run on automated ELISA instruments, such as Hamilton and Dynex instruments. Development includes a version of the test to detect human anti-Nucleocapsid protein (NP) and/or human anti-Spike 1 (S1) total antibody for the screening of acute infection in a symptomatic population. Both human anti-NP and anti-S1 IgM and IgG antibodies have been reported to rise in COVID-19 patients within days after the onset of symptoms. With BARDA support, OraSure expects to request FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within the next five months or sooner.

The completion of these studies is necessary for the company to seek FDA approval of ceftobiprole to treat bloodstream infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This continued funding represents partial funding as this is a cost sharing arrangement with the company and highlights the commitment of both parties to bring novel antimicrobials forward to potential FDA approval. Staphylococcus aureus infections can lead to sepsis, one of the most common causes of death in U.S. hospitals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 270,000 people die from sepsis every year in the Unite States. BARDA awarded the contract to Basilea in 2016 to evaluate ceftobiprole in two Phase 3 clinical trials to treat bacterial skin infections and bloodstream infections. Ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that targets Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. In addition, because of the ceftobiprole’s novel mechanism of action, bacteria are less likely to become resistant to the drug. About Basilea: The following information is provided by company and does not indicate endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products. Basilea is a mid-sized commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. Basilea focuses on the development of innovative products that address the medical challenges in the oncology and infectious diseases therapeutic areas. In addition to ceftobiprole, Basilea’s portfolio includes isavuconazole (trade name Cresemba, an antifungal for treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis), the clinical-stage oncology drugs lisavanbulin and derazantinib, and a number of earlier-stage compounds in the antibacterial and oncological spaces.

With BARDA’s support the company will conduct additional product development work and complete a 510(k) filing for this updated panel. The test detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and is intended for use with the company’s IVD MAGPIX® molecular diagnostic system. This high-throughput option will add testing capacity in the U.S. on equipment currently installed in many U.S. healthcare facilities. Test results are available in less than four hours. Luminex received FDA Emergency Use Authorization on March 27, 2020 for the NxTAG® CoV Extended Panel in North America and has already been shipping it out as a Research Use Only (RUO) version to Europe and the Far East. With the expanded development work, viral targets on the NxTAG® Respiratory Pathogen Panel will be updated; the SARS-CoV-2 target will be added, and the combined panel will be submitted for both EUA and 510(k) to provide customers a more accurate, longer term syndromic testing solution. Additionally, this new panel is expected to have expanded sample claims, including DrySwab, which will eliminate the need for extraction prior to running the test. This approach shortens the turnaround time and reduces the need for extraction reagents which would be beneficial for patients, healthcare providers, and laboratories should a shortage of RNA extraction kits continue in the United States.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command, to provide approximately $31 million to Cytiva for vaccine-related consumable products, such as liquid and dry powder cell culture media, cell culture buffers and mixer bags, as well as hardware including XDR bioreactors. “As part of Operation Warp Speed, we are expanding U.S.-based manufacturing of the products that are essential in the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “By expanding capacity now, not only do we help deliver these products as quickly as possible, but we also return manufacturing to America, boosting the economy and preparing us for future crises.” Under the agreement, the company will expand manufacturing capacity in the company’s Massachusetts facilities and create duplicate capabilities in Cytiva’s Utah facilities to be complete in less than 12 months. Currently, the company only manufactures consumables in Massachusetts. Cytiva is a major manufacturer of pharmaceutical consumables and hardware products and the primary supplier to many of the companies currently working with the U.S. government to develop COVID-19 vaccines. This capacity expansion will help Cytiva respond to the demand for COVID-19 vaccine consumables and hardware products without impacting on current manufacturing output. The agreement with Cytiva is the latest to increase manufacturing capacity in the United States to aid in developing, manufacturing, and administering COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. To date, the federal government has obligated a total of more than $1.1 billion to purchase needles, syringes, vials and supply kits, and to expand the capacity to manufacture these ancillary supplies and the fill-finish manufacturing capacity in the United States for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.

WEB ANNOUNCEMENT Share BARDA and Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. of Hauppauge, New York, are collaborating on the development of two COVID-19-related tests that leverage Chembio’s proprietary Dual Path Platform (DPP®) and provide results in under 20 minutes. The first is the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system that rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 antigen in nasal swabs. This test received initial funding from BARDA in July 2020. Chembio submitted an EUA package on Oct 15, 2020, for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test. The new collaboration leverages the existing partnership to request 510(k) clearance of this test, as well as to develop and request an EUA on an expanded respiratory panel diagnostic. The second is the DPP Respiratory Panel antigen test system which simultaneously detects and differentiates between influenza A, influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 using a single nasal or nasopharyngeal sample. BARDA funding should enable the company to seek Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the test for use during the 2020-2021 influenza season. If authorized or approved, both tests could be used at point-of-care, enabling timely patient management and support containment of COVID-19. During current and future influenza seasons, public health professionals and healthcare providers need rapid, point-of-care testing to determine if individuals with symptoms of respiratory illness have flu or COVID-19. Rapid testing enables these professionals to quickly determine the cause of the illness in order to make appropriate and timely treatment decisions, as well as contain continued spread of COVID-19. Both tests utilize Chembio’s Micro Reader 1 (MR-1) and Micro Reader 2 (MR-2) analyzers. The FDA previously cleared the MR-1 for use with Chembio’s multiplex test for Human Immunodefiency Virus (HIV) and Syphilis, and its test for Zika virus.

The algorithm is designed to integrate into the electronic health record (EHR) and, in real-time, inform healthcare providers of their patients’ conditions, identifying patients who require mechanical ventilation or interventions to maintain sufficient blood pressure. This tool will continuously assess patient status and alerts medical staff of high-risk cases before the patient’s condition deteriorates. eCART monitors nearly 100 variables in the patients’ EHRs and performs millions of simultaneous, near-real-time calculations for each patient. The tool draws attention to worrisome patterns within the EHR system before patients require ventilation or hemodynamic support, allowing medical staff to prioritize these patients and intervene quickly if their conditions worsen. This work will support regulatory approval and also has the potential to aid in allocation of resources, such as ventilators and ICU beds, to the most critical cases, thereby improving COVID-19 patient outcomes. COVID-19 patients have potential for serious or critical outcomes that could lead to significant breathing challenges, cardiac problems, and life-threatening decreases in blood pressure. Healthcare providers need a way to identify such changes in the conditions of their high-risk COVID-19 patients in order to provide the best treatments at the right moment. In this way, eCART has the potential to shorten hospitalization stays, reduce costs from unnecessary treatments, and save patients’ lives. The eCART tool also can streamline medical staff workflows, allowing them to provide greater attention to more patients and treat each individual’s specific medical needs.

Description Avian flu A(H7N9) virus has been known to cause severe, often fatal, lower respiratory disease in humans. We report the findings of a clinical study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of a new recombinant hemagglutinin H7 subtype influenza vaccine in healthy adults. The recombinant H7 vaccine was safe and well-tolerated, with a safety and immunogenicity profile comparable to that of the egg-/cell-based vaccines produced in response to the A(H7N9) viruses from the 2013 epidemic wave. The results from this study provide critical information to develop a pandemic response strategy and support regulatory requirements for vaccination under Emergency Use Authorization.

Evaluation of acute chlorine exposure is complicated by the virtual lack of reliable biomarkers. Using our new chlorine exposure assay for hair and lung tissue samples and our improved chlorinated tyrosine quantitative assay, we report that chlorine exposure biomarker levels are more abundant and detectable for a greater duration in hair than in lung and blood.

The Burdens of Sepsis, 2012–2018 Description BARDA partnered with CMS to study and report on sepsis among Medicare beneficiaries. In the first of a 3-paper series, we identified more than 9.5M sepsis inpatient hospital admissions during 2012–2018. Over this interval, annual admission counts increased more than 65% to nearly 1.7M in 2018; the total 2018 cost of sepsis hospitalizations and skilled nursing facility care for beneficiaries exceeded $41.5B, excluding pre/post-stay care or any professional fees. While sepsis mortality continues to decline, it remains quite high (Fig. 3).

The Trajectories of Sepsis, 2012–2018 Description In paper 2 of 3, we analyzed the trajectories of individual Medicare patients during and after inpatient hospital admissions. While inpatient admission from a nursing facility (vs. from home) was more likely to be due to sepsis, patient characteristics did not otherwise predict whether admission would be due to sepsis or another reason. Sepsis patients consume an increasing fraction of inpatient days and hospital beds. Unfortunately, sepsis has significant adverse effects 6 months after inpatient admission (Fig. 6).

The Methods, Models, and Forecasts of Sepsis, 2012–2018 Description Paper 3 in our 3-paper series forecasted long-term costs for Medicare beneficiaries. These informed a lower-bound, rough-order-of-magnitude national cost of $62B/+ for 2019; this estimate included all Americans but excluded pre/post hospital care, professional fees, and costs of care for veterans or active duty military. We forecasted $100B/+ before 2025, noting: “ …financial forecasts are influenced strongly by catastrophic events; appearance of a global pandemic such as the 1918 “Spanish Flu” would incur costs far in excess of financial forecasts generated by the models discussed.” COVID did not yet exist.

Diagnostics inform the appropriate use of medical countermeasures, minimizing the quantity of said countermeasures that must be stockpiled. They also inform follow on care of casualties and they reassure concerned citizens that have not been injured during an incident. BARDA funds the development of diagnostic countermeasures for use in central laboratory facilities and at the point of care. The diagnostics developed for CBRN threats are guided by the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) implementation plan. BARDA advertises specific diagnostic developments of interest through the CBRN Broad Agency Announcement and specific targeted solicitations. BARDA has funded 11 contracts for development of Biodosimetry diagnostic tools for radiation exposure threats. 6 of these 11 contractors have shown the feasibility of their proposed diagnostic and continue to receive BARDA funds and support for advanced development. While BARDA has not yet funded diagnostic developments for biological and chemical threats, future plans will address these areas once the specific needs and performance parameters for the products are better defined. Biothreat Diagnostics Biodosimetry Diagnostic tests play a critical role in the early and accurate detection of infection from biothreat agents and thus are key components of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) medical countermeasures portfolio. Guided by the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy (2012) (PDF - 543 KB), BARDA’s Biothreat Diagnostics Program is developing test systems (assays and test platforms) to respond to biothreat emergencies. Identifying through FDA-cleared rapid and accurate diagnostic tests those who are in early stages of infection with a listed biothreat agent will allow appropriate triage, patient management and allocation of medical therapeutics and resources. Strategically administering targeted therapeutics to individuals in response diagnostic test results will save lives and resources during a biothreat event. Currently there are only limited available diagnostic test capabilities for biothreats like anthrax, and none of those are available in the clinical diagnostics market. The diagnostics being developed with support from this program are intended for use in both commercial laboratories that require rigorous test protocols and trained technicians, and in point-of-care settings enabling near-patient diagnoses at the primary care level. Point-of-care tests have the potential to improve the management of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings where laboratory infrastructure is weak or has been compromised, and access to quality and timely medical care might be a challenge. In either setting, these tests offer rapid results compared to existing test methodologies that are available today only within the CDC laboratory response network, allowing for timely initiation of appropriate therapy and/or facilitation of linkages to care and referral. Another important aspect of the test platforms under development by BARDA is their ability to be used for routine healthcare testing, making the platforms more readily available and familiar to users when needed in an emergency. Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), BARDA was charged with developing medical countermeasures (MCMs) to address radiological and nuclear threats to the United States as determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. In the aftermath of an improvised nuclear device (IND) detonation or a nuclear accident, having rapid and accurate measurements of internal ionizing radiation absorption in exposed persons can inform life-saving medical decisions. The biodosimetry test is a dose-dependent measurement of the biological changes caused by ionizing radiation and the body’s healing response. The test results will assist physicians in deciding the level, duration, and combination of medical care administered to an individual. BARDA’s Biodosimetry Program focuses on supporting the advanced development, verification and validation of biomarker assays and biodosimeter devices through partnerships with industry and the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE). The program’s main goals are to support development and procurement of assays and devices capable of rapid measurement ionizing radiation absorbed by exposed persons allowing prioritization of limited resources. In radiation disasters, the population is likely to encounter a number of complex exposure scenarios, including different dose ranges and rates. Therefore, triage and definitive radiation biodosimetry will require multiple tests to measure absorbed dose in patients. Qualitative point-of-care tests are designed to determine quickly whether an individual has absorbed a minimum threshold dose of radiation and needs further medical care. BARDA’s Biodosimetry Program has partnered with 11 commercial and academic test developers to develop biomarkers and assays, and to evaluate many potentially useful technological methods for use in point-of-care and high-throughput settings. Five (5) of the most promising tests using the most relevant proteomic, genomic and cytologic radiation markers remain supported by BARDA, including support to validate their utility in animal models and humans. BARDA is supporting development of two (2) point-of-care tests using different technologies with blood samples (a multiplex lateral-flow immunoassay test and a multi-array cartridge-based electrochemiluminescent test) and three (3) high-throughput laboratory-based tests that estimate the actual absorbed radiation dose received. Two (2) of the high-throughput tests under development use changes in gene expression patterns from whole blood drawn into specialized collection and stabilization blood tubes to determine the extent of radiation damage. The third high-throughput test advancing toward a product measures chromosomal damage and micronucleus generation to predict absorbed dose. In 2016, BARDA transitioned two (2) of the high-throughput devices to late-stage development and procurement under Project BioShield. BARDA anticipates additional programs to transition in 2017. BARDA’s Biodosimetry Program will continue to work with federal and industry partners to enable the development and acquisition of radiation biodosimeter devices. A long-term goal is to have at least one point-of-care and one high-throughput laboratory-based biodosimetry test cleared by the FDA by the end of the decade and ready for procurement under Project BioShield. Ultimately, the Biodosimetry Program’s continued success will help the United States prepare for and respond effectively to a radiological incident or nuclear accident such as that at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/cbrn/broad-spectrum-antimicrobials/","Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials","Your description","Skip to main content U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), and Pandemic and All-Hazards Reauthorization Act (2013) (PDF - 284 KB), BARDA’s strategy to support advanced development of critical medical countermeasures targets biothreats that have been determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. Guided by the BARDA Strategic Plan (2011-2016) (PDF - 2.31 MB) and PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation Plans (2012 and 2014), BARDA’s Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials Program uses novel public-private partnerships to incentivize research and development of novel antimicrobial drug candidates primarily through advanced development of drug candidates toward FDA approval. The product candidates funded by this program typically have broad spectrum activity across biothreats, including Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), Burkholderia mallei (glanders), B. pseudomallei (melioidosis) and other pathogens that could pose a threat to national or global security. Program investments ensure that therapeutic options are available in the event of drug resistance to antibiotics in the Strategic National Stockpile. Novel treatment options, as well as diagnostics to detect resistance, are critical to ensure timely, appropriate treatment of microbial infections. To date, the Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials Program has supported advanced development of twelve (12) antimicrobial drug candidates. Four (4) of these are currently in Phase 3 clinical development for commercial indications (e.g. bacterial pneumonitis). In addition, the commercial indications have provided robust human safety datasets that are important for any biothreat indication. New Drug Application submissions for one (1) of these product candidates occurred in 2016 with two (2) additional applications anticipated in 2017. This program also utilizes HHS’ Other Transactional Authority—the first usage since it was authorized through PAHPA in 2006. To-date, BARDA has established four (4) agreements with large pharmaceutical companies; GlaxoSmithKine (GSK), AstraZeneca, The Medicines Company, and Hoffmann-La Roche. The 5-year Other Transaction Agreements are flexible, innovative projects that allow BARDA to support a portfolio of candidate products in a novel way: resources and product candidates can move in and out of the program as technical risk and programmatic needs vary over time. These partnerships allow collaborative decisions on the strategic direction and composition of research and development portfolios to be made by BARDA and industry together. BARDA's strategy of addressing biothreats and pathogens that may pose a threat to national or global security has provided non-dilutive capital to companies that previously would have exited the antibiotic space because of the high risk and low return on investment. The Combating Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria (CARB) Initiative incorporates many of BARDA’s Broad Spectrum Antimicrobial Program’s efforts and directs BARDA to address antimicrobial resistance in pathogens of urgent or serious public health concern. This program will add to BARDA’s portfolio and encourage connections among MCM projects that are making available new diagnostic platforms and antimicrobials for bioterrorism threats, with added benefits for antimicrobial drug resistance in high priority public health pathogens. In addition to supporting the CARB Initiative, BARDA launched CARB-X (combating antimicrobial resistant bacteria accelerator) in 2016. The Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, was created to help address the threat of antibiotic resistance. CARB-X is one of the world’s largest public-private partnerships focused on preclinical discovery and development of new antimicrobial products. CARB-X is a collaboration between NIAID and BARDA and four life science accelerators including the Wellcome Trust of London, the California Life Sciences Institute, Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, and the AMR Centre in the United Kingdom. Boston University is the lead institution for CARB-X. RTI International and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have joined the partnership with RTI providing technical and research support services and Broad conducting early antibiotic discovery. CARB-X partners are working together to accelerate antibacterial product development over the next 25 years. This partnership promotes innovation and could provide hundreds of millions of dollars over five years to increase the number of antibiotics in the drug-development pipeline. CARB-X is working to set up a diverse portfolio with more than 20 high-quality antibacterial products. That’s dozens more than a company normally can take on. So the chances of getting innovative products into clinical testing within five years are higher than normal. The end goal of CARB-X is to move promising antibiotic candidates through earlier stages of research and development, so that they merit private or public investment to advance to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and/or the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom.

By funding this advanced research and development effort, the product will progress toward potential Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Sulfur mustard is a type of chemical warfare agent that causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. Sulfur mustard is a powerful irritant that damages the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Toxicity is thought to be caused primarily by DNA damage. In the eye, initial signs and symptoms of sulfur mustard exposure include irritation, pain, swelling and tearing that occur within three to twelve hours after exposure. However, delayed effects can include corneal opacification and permanent blinding. Acute infectious conjunctivitis, a common eye condition, also causes DNA damage. Treatment for this condition is a large unmet need, and an effective treatment for DNA damage could have a significant, positive impact in this field of medicine. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs to treat sulfur mustard ocular injury. Advanced research and development to include nonclinical IND-enabling studies and clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of candidate therapeutics are needed to fill this unmet need. INV-102 is derived from a naturally occurring small molecule that modulates the activity of p53, the central protein that regulates the DNA damage response. As an eye drop, INV-102 has the potential to treat the delayed, long-term eye injury and blindness observed after sulfur mustard exposure. If approved, INV-102 would be the first clinically effective treatment for sulfur mustard ocular injury. Additionally, the broad indication would open the market potential for the drug, thereby increasing community availability and sustainability, two key requirements in rapid response to a chemical incident. About Invirsa: The following information is provided by company and does not indicate endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products. Invirsa is an Ohio pharmaceutical company with a lead compound that provides damage control at the DNA level. By quickly and predictably augmenting the body’s response to DNA damage, INV-102 improves cell stability at the critical moment. Invirsa plans to enter clinical trials in the near future for indications related to the eye, acute infectious keratoconjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. In addition, Invirsa intends to expand its platform into other conditions associated with DNA damage such as herpes keratitis and viral pneumonia.

This work will lead to a better understanding of how the human lung reacts to a toxic Cl2 exposure, which will enable the discovery of new and effective treatments. If successful, the lung-on-a-chip technology could be used to discover new treatments for inhalation of other inhaled toxic chemical. Dan Huh, associate professor in Penn’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, and G. Scott Worthen, a professor of pediatrics at Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine and a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, have collaborated on developing a series of organ-on-a-chip platforms. These devices incorporate human cells into precisely engineered microfluidic channels that mimic an organ’s natural environment, providing a way to conduct experiments that would not otherwise be feasible. Chlorine gas was used as a weapon during World War I and has been used repeatedly during the ongoing Syrian civil war. Chlorine also is one of the most-used industrial gases in the United States and causes multiple deaths and injuries due to accidents. In 2005, a train accident in Graniteville, South Carolina caused a tank car containing chlorine gas to leak, causing nine deaths and at least 250 injuries. There are no effective treatments for chlorine inhalation. Penn’s lung-on-a-chip will increase scientific understanding of the damage inflicted by chlorine gas on lung tissue and point the way to innovative treatments. The chip technology can subsequently be used for high-throughput screening of drug candidates and speed the development of the promising ones. Organ-on-a-chip is a potentially disruptive technology. Human analogue organs could provide pre-clinical data on drug safety and efficacy using human-like tissue and yield quicker, cheaper, and more realistic results than traditional non-clinical testing. Once organ-on-a-chip technology is validated against data from human patients, the technology could greatly reduce the need for animal testing in drug development.

Under the partnership agreements announced today, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, will provide advanced development expertise and funding to each company to support Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials and other activities required to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). BARDA will provide an initial $7.36 million and up to a total of $76.9 million over nine-and-a-half years to Vedanta Biosciences, Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to support development of VE303 to prevent C. difficile infections. BARDA also will provide an initial $11 million and up to a total of $77 million over five years to Locus Biosciences of Morrisville, North Carolina, part of a $144 million program to develop LBP-EC01 to treat recurrent UTIs including those caused by antibiotic-resistant E. coli. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 identified these two infections as urgent public health threats. If approved, these drugs would represent innovative approaches to preventing and treating the targeted infections. Antibiotic-resistant infections are a particular concern with large-scale use of antibiotics to treat secondary infections during a pandemic, such as those caused by H1N1 influenza or SARS-CoV-2, and in treating infections caused by biothreat agents, such as anthrax or tularemia, that require 60 days or more of antibiotic therapy. “Healthcare providers need tools at-the-ready to prevent or combat secondary bacterial infections, particularly those that impact a patient’s successful recovery following antibiotic usage in a public health emergency,” said BARDA Acting Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “Infections associated with long-term antibiotic use are a growing concern and are often costly to treat which makes developing novel drugs and technologies for prevention and treatment all the more urgent for U.S. health security.” In the United States, C. difficile causes up to quarter of a million infections each year; an estimated 20 percent of these patients suffer recurring infections, and the infection is responsible for at least 12,800 deaths annually. This bacterial infection is associated with antibiotic use, particularly prolonged use of certain classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment can deplete the human body’s natural, protective, gastrointestinal bacteria, allowing C. difficile to colonize and overgrow in the intestines. Vedanta Biosciences’ VE303 focuses on restoring the normal balance of beneficial bacteria naturally found in the human digestive tract, including to prevent recurrence of C. difficile. VE303 is an investigational, rationally defined, live biotherapeutic product (LBP) given as a pill (oral capsule). VE303 consists of eight well-characterized bacteria that commonly reside in the intestine of healthy people of all ages and do not cause harm to the body. Vedanta’s drug candidate received early development support from CARB-X, the world’s largest public-private partnership dedicated to accelerating antibacterial research to tackle the global rising threat of drug-resistant bacteria. BARDA, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, and Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom launched CARB-X in 2016. VE303 is the seventh product to graduate from CARB-X and the second CARB-X candidate to receive BARDA’s advanced development support. If successful, VE303 could become the first FDA-approved live bio-therapeutic product to address this urgent threat to public health. VE303 also represents the first live bio-therapeutic product BARDA has supported. Locus Biosciences’ LBP-EC01uses a combination of CRISPR-Cas3 technology and bacteriophages (viruses that only infect bacterial cells) to treat recurrent UTIs caused by E. coli, including those that are antibiotic-resistant. The bacteriophages inject their DNA into E. coli bacteria, replicate and cause the bacteria to burst, killing them. The CRISPR-Cas3 technology, meanwhile, permanently degrades the DNA of the target bacterial cell, killing any E. coli cells that might have otherwise escaped being killed by the bacteriophage on its own. Worldwide, an estimated 150 million UTIs occur each year; the majority affect women, highlighting the severity of this issue to women’s health. Approximately 80 percent of these infections are caused by E. coli, and up to 40 percent of people experience a recurrence within months of the first episode. The CDC has identified antibiotic-resistant E. coli as an urgent and serious public health threat requiring development of new treatments. If successful, LBP-EC01could become the first CRISPR engineered bacteriophage therapy to be approved by the FDA. BARDA’s partnership with Locus Biosciences also may foster the development of a new regulatory pathway for bacteriophage therapeutics and similar innovative products.

As part of this collaboration, Cepheid completed optimization and validation of the test, and the test was granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the current coronavirus outbreak. The test is developed for use on Cepheid’s GeneXpert diagnostic platform which is used world-wide to test for other infections, such as tuberculosis, HIV, Group A Streptococcus (strep), and influenza. The COVID-19 test can provide results within 45 minutes, and is designed for use in clinical and hospital laboratories. To support this development work, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), will provide Cepheid with technical expertise and approximately $3.7 million in initial funding by using an existing agreement between the company and the DoD’s Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND). Additional funding is planned as the program progresses. “Diagnostics that provide rapid results at the point-of-care are essential to healthcare professionals in making treatment decisions, to patients in guiding their actions to curb the spread of infections, and to public health officials in their community-based efforts to mitigate coronavirus outbreaks,” said BARDA Director Rick A. Bright, Ph.D. “We have been working quickly with counterparts across the U.S. government to identify potential products for advanced development, and we are grateful to the JPEO and Cepheid for collaborating with us to move this forward.” “As part of our mission to protect soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines from CBRN threats, the JPEO-CBRND works with the private sector to develop and modernize diagnostics capabilities against biological threats. Through leveraging expertise across the government, both the efforts and outcomes achieve greater success,” said Mr. Douglas Bryce, Joint Program Executive Officer for CBRN Defense. “We are extremely pleased to assist BARDA in our nation’s effort to provide COVID-19, novel or emerging coronavirus diagnostic tests to our nation's healthcare providers and public health officials. This collaboration is saving valuable time and dollars and it is a testament to the work that the BARDA and JPEO-CBRND teams have and will accomplish together.” JPEO-CBRND has worked with Cepheid over the past 18 months to develop military relevant tests for hemorrhagic and tropical fevers to diagnosis biothreat and syndromic endemic diseases of operational concern. In addition to developing a COVID-19 test, future collaboration between BARDA, JPEO-CBRND and Cepheid could include a diagnostic test on the GeneXpert platform that can detect and differentiate known human coronaviruses and detect novel or emerging coronaviruses. Such a test could alert healthcare providers and public health officials quickly of future outbreaks involving new coronaviruses, giving them valuable time to take action that could limit the spread of a new disease. FDA issued emergency use authorization for diagnostic tests from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other authorized public health laboratories, and for use of New York State’s Wadsworth diagnostics test. In addition, FDA also issued a new policy Feb. 29 to help expedite the availability of diagnostics. HHS continues to work across the U.S. government, including with the Department of Defense, to review potential products from public and private sectors to identify promising candidates that could detect, protect against or treat COVID-19 for development and licensure. HHS divisions, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and ASPR, have begun supporting development of multiple vaccines and potential therapeutic treatments for COVID-19. To obtain information about any potential products in development in the private sector that could be used in responding to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. government launched a single point-of-entry website for innovators and product developers to submit brief descriptions of their diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other products or technologies being developed for COVID-19. To shorten the time to apply for product licensure and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, federal agencies are particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that have progressed beyond non-clinical studies, have established domestic large-scale manufacturing capability with commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and have utilized a platform used to manufacture a product already approved by the FDA.

By funding the manufacturing effort, the federal government will own the doses that result from the demonstration project. The adjuvanted vaccine doses could be used in clinical trials or, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes use, as outlined in agency guidance, the doses would be distributed as part of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. “The portfolio of vaccines being assembled for Operation Warp Speed increases the odds that we will have at least one safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Today’s investment supports our latest vaccine candidate, an adjuvanted product being developed by Sanofi and GSK, all the way through clinical trials and manufacturing, with the potential to bring hundreds of millions of safe and effective doses to the American people.” The manufacturing demonstration project will take place while clinical trials are underway. Working in parallel this way expedites the traditional vaccine development timeline. This step builds toward the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed goal to begin delivering millions of doses of safe and effective vaccine to the American people by the end of the year. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and the Army Contracting Command to provide approximately $2 billion to support late-stage development, clinical trials, including a large-scale phase 3 efficacy clinical trial, and the manufacturing demonstration project. The U.S. government also has the ability to acquire up to 500 million additional doses. The project also includes fill-finish manufacturing in the United States so that vaccine doses are packaged and ready to ship immediately if clinical trials are successful and FDA authorizes use. If these doses are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the vaccine would be available to the American people at no cost. As is customary with government-purchased vaccines, healthcare professionals could charge for the cost of administering the vaccine. Both companies have long-standing relationships with BARDA. Today’s effort with Sanofi builds on initial vaccine development work undertaken through a flexible agreement between BARDA and Protein Sciences, part of Sanofi, and work with GSK on adjuvant for pandemic influenza vaccines. The vaccine candidate uses an antigen from Sanofi, which stimulates the body’s immune response against the virus, based on recombinant DNA technology and is being developed using an adjuvant from GSK to enhance the immune response, reduce the amount of antigen required per dose, and improve the chances of delivering an effective vaccine that can be manufactured at scale. GSK’s manufacturing scale is supported through U.S.-based reactivation efforts funded by BARDA since 2018.

Currently, Actemra® is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and in more than 100 countries to treat rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. Patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing life-threatening respiratory failure, which may be mediated in part by elevated levels of a series of pro-inflammatory molecules, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). Actemra ® is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-6 receptor on normal cells and may improve patient outcomes by decreasing the severe inflammatory response. Therapeutic treatments, antiviral drugs and vaccines are critical in combating 2019 novel coronavirus infections (COVID-19). BARDA is providing $25 million toward the clinical trial to determine if Actemra ® can reduce the duration of severe illness and hospitalization in a person infected with the novel coronavirus . If found to be safe and effective by the FDA, the therapeutic could be used in conjunction with future COVID-19-specific antiviral therapeutics.

This innovative and monumental partnership has enabled NIH and Moderna to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine within the span of a year that will be manufactured and distributed across the U.S. The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine against COVID-19 encoding a prefusion stabilized form of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, co-developed by investigators from Moderna and NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center. The approach to stabilize the coronavirus spike protein, called S-2P, was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at Scripps Research, Dartmouth College and the University of Texas at Austin. NIAID supported the early development of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and worked with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) scientists to support the mid- and late-stages of clinical development, with BARDA leading government support of the scale-up of manufacturing and regulatory pathway to EUA. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is the second COVID-19 vaccine in the United States to be granted an EUA. NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., and BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. released the following statements: “It has been less than a year since the world first learned of SARS-CoV-2 and the terrible disease it can cause. To have not one but two safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccines ready for deployment to the American public is truly a remarkable scientific achievement, and a significant step toward ending the pandemic that has caused so much suffering. The partnership to develop the mRNA-1273 vaccine is a prime example of the tremendous good that can be accomplished when the public and private sectors work together to address a serious public health problem. It is through the dedicated efforts of our federal scientists and their collaborators at Moderna and in academia, the clinical staff who conducted the vaccine’s rigorous clinical trials, and the tens of thousands of study participants who selflessly rolled up their sleeves, that another safe and highly effective vaccine to protect against COVID-19 will soon be rolled out to the American public.” – NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “Several years before SARS-CoV-2 entered the public consciousness, NIAID scientists were working with Moderna to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses. That existing scientific foundation is what enabled both partners to move quickly to develop the mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. NIAID conducted the initial Phase 1 testing of the vaccine and, with the support of BARDA and other Operation Warp Speed partners, played a central role in its large-scale clinical trial. Throughout each stage of clinical testing, the Moderna vaccine proved to be safe and highly effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. In a study of more than 30,000 people, it demonstrated 94% efficacy, and subsequent analyses have revealed that the vaccine induces a durable immune response. There is much we still do not know about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. However, we do know that this vaccine is safe and can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 and severe disease. It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them. That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward. ” – NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “Today stands as a reminder of what can be accomplished when people come together to reach a common goal. We are working with a constant sense of urgency to bring vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to bear to end the crisis. As partners in Operation Warp Speed, NIAID and BARDA scientists collaborated with Moderna, adding BARDA’s expertise in late-stage clinical trials, scale-up manufacturing and regulatory requirements. By collaborating, we were able to complete these steps in parallel and accelerate the development of a safe and effective vaccine. While we celebrate today’s accomplishment, we recognize that there is still much work to do to ensure every American who wants a COVID-19 vaccine receives one. Every American has been touched in some way by this virus, and so we will continue to push forward. With continued collaboration and investment in scientific research, health security, and innovative public-private partnerships, we can achieve a safer, more prepared world.” – BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. Francis Collins, M.D., is Director of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., is Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.

The conference ends as 5:00pm both days. Is there somewhere I can store my coat and/or personal items? Coat check will be offered for coats and luggage on both days of the conference on the Constitution Level of the Grand Hyatt. There is a small cash fee of $3 per each item checked (fee is per item, not per person). Are there hotel rooms or a room block set aside for BARDA attendees this year? Regrettably we are unable to offer a hotel room block at this time. Please visit the Hotels page on our website for information on hotels in DC near the conference. When will online registration be open? When does it close? Online registration is now closed. Will on-site registration be available? Yes, limited onsite registration will be available, pending capacity. We cannot guarantee space will be available. If you are unsure if you can make it to D.C. you may be interested in one of our Accelerator Network Hybrid Events. What are the Accelerator Network Hybrid Events? How do they relate to BARDA Industry Day 2019 in D.C.? Nothing can compare to being in D.C. for the full two-day BARDA Industry Day conference. However, we want to provide an opportunity for individuals across the country, who may not be able to make it to D.C., to learn more about BARDA and our partners. Therefore, our Accelerator Network will be hosting hybrid video streaming events at their locations, capturing all of our general session speakers on October 15th. Reference the specific Accelerator events for exact details about the hybrid event at each site. Accelerators in Eastern Time will livestream the event while Accelerators in other time zones may follow a locally-specific schedule. These special hybrid events will be an excellent local networking opportunity within our Accelerator communities! NOTE: Please only register for either the in-person BARDA Industry Day 2019 in D.C. or for an Accelerator Network Hybrid Event. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate requests for a combination of Network event attendance and in-person attendance. Why are there two venues listed this year? How will I know which hotel my session is being held in? There are two venues on Day 2 of the conference ONLY. All Day 1 (Tuesday) activities will be held at the Grand Hyatt. On Day 2 (Wednesday) some activities will be held at the Marriott at Metro Center. Further Details: Both venues are hotels that are easily accessible by Metro as well as various other forms of transit. The venues are located across the street from one another, separated by a walk of 3-5 minutes. The Marriott will host several workshops and educational sessions as a part of Day 2 of our BID2019 programming. Locations will be listed on the Event Agenda, and our wonderful BARDA Staff will be available to provide guidance and directions at both meeting sites. I’m unfamiliar with the Metro System. Any advice for navigating to BID? The closest metro station is Metro Center. It can be reached via the Silver, Red, Blue, or Orange line trains. For more assistance planning your metro ride, you can visit the Metro Trip Creator HERE. What is the proper dress code for this conference? Business or business casual attire. Where is the nearest coffee shop? There are a wide variety of nearby coffee shops. There are also shops in both the Grand Hyatt and the Marriott – though lines for these can be quite long. What are Lightning Talks? Lightning Talks are a unique way we try to engage with our industry partners at BARDA Industry Day, and are open to any attendees who want the opportunity to pitch their medical countermeasures innovation. If your application is accepted you will have 6 minutes to give a quick-fire style mini-briefing to a room of BARDA experts and industry stakeholders! What is the deadline to apply to present a Lightning Talk at BID2019? The application deadline for your Lightning Talk submission is 11:59 pm EST on Friday, September 13th, 2019. What is the difference between Lightning Talks and a TechWatch Meeting at BID? Lightning Talks are a public pitch of a technology or technique to attendees. TechWatch Meetings at BID are a private discussion between a company and BARDA. While TechWatch meetings are also a great way to “pitch” BARDA on your idea, they’re also a chance to solicit advice and delve a little deeper into specifics that wouldn’t be appropriate for an open forum. What’s the difference between a TechWatch meeting at BID and a normal BARDA TechWatch? They’re very similar. TechWatch meetings at BID will be a little shorter (15-20 minutes) and will only be in-person. We’ll be giving a slight preference to groups that have travelled a long way, since we know how challenging it can be for companies to make it to D.C. for a standard TechWatch meeting. If we aren’t able to schedule you for a TechWatch at BID meeting our TechWatch team will follow up with you to ensure we can still arrange a conversation between your team and BARDA subject matter experts. TechWatch Meeting at BID requests must be received by 11:59PM Eastern Time on Friday, September 27th. Presented By",,"September 20th 2019, 09:11:15.000",

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/cbrn/ebola/",Ebola,"Your description","Skip to main content U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Ebola In August, 2014, BARDA responded to the Ebola epidemic by working with our PHEMCE and industry partners to transition early stage therapeutic and vaccine candidates (supported by NIH and DoD) into BARDA’s advanced development programs. Ebola Therapeutics Ebola Vaccines Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), and Pandemic and All-Hazards Reauthorization Act (2013) (PDF - 284 KB), BARDA’s strategy to support advanced development of critical medical countermeasures (MCMs) targets biothreats that have been determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. The material threat determinations for Ebola and Marburg were issued in September, 2006. The Ebola epidemic of 2014-2015 in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone demonstrates that this virus is also an emerging infectious disease. BARDA’s Ebola MCM strategy for development, manufacturing and evaluation of monoclonal antibody and antiviral drug therapeutic candidates has three goals: make clinical trial materials with industry partners, ensure safety and efficacy evaluation in animal or clinical studies, and support improved product manufacturing toward FDA approval. In August, 2014, BARDA responded to the Ebola epidemic by working with our PHEMCE and industry partners to transition early stage therapeutic and vaccine candidates (supported by NIH and DoD) into BARDA’s advanced development programs. This filled the last gap in BARDA’s CBRN MCM development programs. BARDA is supporting the advanced development of six (6) monoclonal antibody candidates and one (1) antiviral drug candidate for treatment of Ebola. ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical), which is formulated and filled by BARDA’s Fill Finish Manufacturing Network, is a tobacco-based monoclonal antibody cocktail currently under clinical evaluation for safety and efficacy to use as a therapeutic in West Africa. Other Ebola monoclonal antibody candidates from Regeneron and Genentech (partnered with BARDA) are utilizing specialized Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and other monoclonal antibody technologies. These new monoclonal antibody candidates are in nonhuman primate challenge studies for safety and efficacy using BARDA’s Nonclinical Studies Network, and manufacturing of future clinical investigational lots is planned at BARDA’s Centers for Innovative Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADMs). Additionally, the Ebola antiviral drug candidate BCX4430 (BioCryst) transitioned from NIH is now in Phase 1 dose-ranging pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies in the U.S. BARDA’s investment in Ebola therapeutics also is bolstered by support for advanced development of diagnostic tests and platform technologies. Rapid, accurate diagnostic tests can facilitate early warning, outbreak control and targeted therapeutic drug therapy for infected patients. The rapid and coordinated support for development of Ebola diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine candidates demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging BARDA’s programs together with the new National MCM Response Infrastructure to respond to today’s crisis and prepare for future Ebola and unknown emerging infectious disease epidemics. Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB),BARDA was charged with developing medical countermeasures to address biothreats to the United States determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. Since Ebola is both a bioterrorism threat and an emerging infectious disease, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), directs BARDA to support advanced development of medical countermeasures for this threat. Established in 2014, BARDA’s Ebola Vaccines Program as part of the U.S. Ebola response focuses on the advanced development, manufacturing, and clinical evaluation of vaccine candidates through collaborations with federal and industry partners. The Program's immediate main goals are to ensure the availability of vaccine investigational lots for clinical trials; support these clinical trials for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy with technical expertise and BARDA’s Clinical Studies Network; transition vaccine manufacturing from pilot to commercial scale; and develop more thermostable vaccines for easier usage and longer storage. The long-term goal of the Ebola Vaccines Program is to support advanced development and procurement of multivalent vaccines effective for prevention of multiple strains of Ebola viruses and Marburg virus. BARDA is supporting in 2015 the advanced development of three (3) Ebola vaccine candidates with several more under consideration. These vaccine candidates include live, attenuated virus vaccines using recombinant adenovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus vectors to express the Ebola G protein. Phase 1 clinical studies on two of these vaccine candidates show they are well tolerated and immunogenic. The program is making rapid progress with these vaccine manufacturers by ensuring clinical investigational lots of vaccine are available, transitioning manufacturing from pilot to commercial scale to increase production capacity, and testing freeze-dried vaccine formulations to increase stability. With its Clinical Studies Network and technical staff, BARDA is aiding CDC to conduct the Ebola vaccine clinical trial that started in April, 2015 in Sierra Leone, testing safety, immunogenicity and efficacy while also addressing logistical issues of frozen vaccine shipping, storage and distribution. Provided the vaccine(s) are shown to be safe and efficacious, BARDA’s Ebola Vaccines Program and Clinical Studies Network, working with international partners, may enable potential mass vaccination campaigns in West Africa to reduce the current Ebola epidemic to zero cases. Ultimately, the Ebola Vaccine Program’s continued success will provide safe and effective vaccines to protect against the next Ebola outbreak (across the world and the United States) from man-made and natural viral hemorrhagic fever virus threats.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/cbrn/thermal-burn/","Thermal Burn","Your description","Skip to main content U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Thermal Burn Under the Project BioShield Act (2004) (PDF - 191 KB), Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006) (PDF -248 KB), BARDA was charged with developing medical countermeasures (MCMs) to address material threats to the United States as determined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND) in a metropolitan area is one such material threat which can have substantial medical consequences including trauma, radiation syndromes, and burn injuries. In alignment with the PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation Plan and the BARDA Strategic Plan (PDF - 2.31 MB), BARDA’s Burn Medical Countermeasures (MCM) Program addresses this threat and the treatment bottlenecks likely to be faced in a mass casualty by identifying and supporting the advanced development of MCM candidates with specific attributes. This program aims to improve burn treatment across the burn care spectrum by supporting MCM candidates that (when combined and incorporated into the mainstream marketplace) have broad, synergistic, and sustainable impact. Enhancing the spectrum of burn injury treatments will increase our preparedness and capacity to respond to the immediate, field care needs of patients after an IND event, as well as those needing further definitive care in hospital settings. Better triage and field care could also reduce patient surges into hospital settings, and new products under development would give burn care facilities more time, reduce burden and manage resources to treat those with the most serious injuries. Given the complex injury progression and treatments necessary in burn care, no one product prepares us to meet the diverse needs of burn patients. To solve these unique challenges in mitigating burn injuries, BARDA’s Burn Program has leveraged knowledge gained from proactive engagement with the end-user community (from first responders to burn surgeons). Through these engagements, BARDA defined a continuum of definitive burn care that has the potential to synergistically improve burn care through the development of multiple well-targeted MCM candidates. BARDA’s current investment in products which target different areas of this continuum could enable the end-users to provide better quality care and value at a potentially lower overall cost. BARDA’s Burn Program currently supports the advanced development of seven (7) MCM candidates towards FDA approval and includes four (4) products supported under Project BioShield in 2015. Each of these products targets a unique aspect of burn injury, ranging from field to definitive care environments. Product candidates include antimicrobial barrier dressings that prevent infection, enzyme-enhanced wound debridement tools, and wound imaging technologies that can improve surgery outcomes for patients needing skin grafts. The near-term program focus is on ensuring regulatory approval for the new burn care treatments and positioning them for adoption in common clinical practice. Towards this end, BARDA supports use of products under Compassionate Use as well as Expanded Access programs when allowed by the FDA. These approaches save lives and engender clinical use prior to product approval. The program will also continue to explore synergies by combining treatments developed across the burn care continuum. Long-term plans include establishing a resilient burn care infrastructure by integrating products into commercial adoption to decrease the need for USG stockpiling. BARDA has also carefully chosen these candidates based on their potential for other clinical indications. By encouraging the adoption of candidate products into clinical practice for use in allied treatments (e.g., diabetic foot ulcers), BARDA will ensure their commercial sustainability while developing a bigger cache of products for use in a public health emergency. Under the Burn Program, BARDA is also identifying candidates that mitigate cutaneous radiation injuries (CRI) which have a distinct etiology and result from exposure of skin to radiation, a likely scenario in an IND detonation. The Burn Program also works collaboratively with the Chemical Program and the new National MCM Response Infrastructure to evaluate thermal burn MCM candidates for their efficacy to also treat chemical burns resulting from exposure to agents like sulfur mustard. BARDA will continue to explore and leverage synergies by supporting development and regulatory approval of treatments across the burn care continuum. Long-term plans include establishing a resilient burn care infrastructure by integrating products into commercial adoption to decrease the need for stockpiling by the U.S. Government.

The recognition is a testament to the success of public-private collaboration in protecting health security. Long before COVID-19, dedicated civil servants were working to prepare the U.S.’s response to pandemics and other public health emergencies. The rapid control of the re-emergence of Ebola in recent months provides dramatic proof that preparedness efforts make a difference in global and domestic public health. In early 2014, the world had limited diagnostics and only preclinical stage vaccines and therapeutics to diagnose, prevent, or treat Ebola. Today the U.S. has four FDA approved, cleared, or licensed medical countermeasures to combat Ebola and some of those technologies are being applied in the COVID-19 pandemic When Ebola hit West Africa in 2014, the Ebola MCM Taskforce at BARDA led by David Boucher, PhD, Dan Wolfe, PhD, and John Lee, PhD, worked with our private sector and government partners on the research and development of therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tests. Products from that work have been used to halt the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in West and Central Africa and avert the possibility of a pandemic. While most of the world has been focused on COVID-19, this team continued to work with our private industry partners and agency colleagues to be sure that the world was able to respond swiftly and effectively when new cases of Ebola emerged last year and again this year. I want to thank the Partnership for Public Service for honoring these scientists. Their work demonstrates the power of medical countermeasures to save lives not only in responding to public health emergencies but also in averting them. Gary L.

The PHEMCE Strategy The first stage is the 2012 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy. The purpose of the HHS PHEMCE Strategy is to establish the goals and objectives that HHS will use to ensure that medical countermeasures are available for effective use against the highest priority CBRN threats facing the Nation. The HHS PHEMCE Strategy considers the full spectrum of medical countermeasure-related activities, including research, development, acquisition, storage and maintenance, deployment, and utilization. The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response led the development of the 2012 PHEMCE Strategy through an interagency steering committee comprised of representatives from across the PHEMCE agencies. The steering committee reviewed existing strategies, implementation plans, and other documents with direct relevance to setting PHEMCE goals and objectives. Full Text: HHS PHEMCE Strategy The PHEMCE Strategy outlines the principles and processes for identifying priority threat areas and requirements for medical countermeasure development and acquisition, including those medical countermeasures to be developed or acquired under the authorities of the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (""Project BioShield"") (P.L.. 108-276) or under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417). The PHEMCE Strategy also sets forth the overall roles and responsibilities of key government agencies contributing to this effort. The PHEMCE Implementation Plan The companion piece to the PHEMCE Strategy is the 2012 PHEMCE Implementation Plan. This Strategy and the Implementation Plan together will provide the blueprints the PHEMCE will follow in the near, mid-, and long-terms to make the best use of available resources to enhance national health security. The HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan is prioritized plan with near-term, mid-term and long-term goals for research, development, and acquisition of medical countermeasures that is consistent with the guiding principles and priority setting criteria defined in the HHS PHEMCE Strategy. The PHEMCE Implementation Plan is supported by a number of HHS funding streams, including NIH biodefense research and development, advanced development monies, Strategic National Stockpile resources and the Special Reserve Fund authorized under Project BioShield.

Read More Innovation Project Spotlight October 2020 Cytovale - San Francisco, CA Patients suffering from COVID-19 have widely variable prognoses. Some are mildly affected, while others experience severe outcomes, hospitalizations, sepsis, and death, making triage critical. Read More Previous Next Applied Research Associates, Inc. develop a reusable elastromeric respirator - Albuquerque, NM × Disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are only safe for a single use, while elastomeric respirators are reusable, but can be challenging to disinfect because they often have multiple parts with hard-to-clean areas. ARA has designed an easy-to-clean, simple-to-use respirator that can be worn up to thousands of times. This respirator consists of a silicone facepiece with integrated straps and two replaceable N95 filters. The facepiece has smooth surfaces to make cleaning easy and has built-in shields intended to protect the filters and make it easy to check the fit. Studies show the ARA-designed respirator is easy to breathe through, fits well, is comfortable to use, has comparable speech intelligibility to FFRs, and protects against eyeglass fogging. The silicone facepiece can be wiped and cleaned between each use. The entire respirator can be washed and sterilized over 100 times with standard hospital equipment while still providing N95 protection, resulting in thousands of uses per mask for health care providers during a pandemic. Director's Perspective: “We’re working with private sector partners to provide respiratory protection options for defense against pathogens and airborne hazards, with safety features at least equivalent if not superior to N95 FFRs,” said Rodney Wallace, Director, Detection, Diagnostics, & Devices Infrastructure Division. “Our goal is to provide a suitable alternative to disposable masks that health care providers feel safe wearing and increase the supply of respirators available for health care settings.” Regeneron's VelociSuite antibody platform technologies - Tarrytown, NY × Regeneron’s VelociSuite platform technologies utilize proprietary, genetically-engineered mice to identify, develop, and efficiently produce fully human monoclonal antibodies. This technology effectively shortens multiple aspects of ‘typical’ drug development timelines from years to months. Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, Regeneron leveraged an existing collaboration with BARDA to progress REGEN-COV™ (casirivimab and imdevimab), a monoclonal antibody cocktail to target SARS-CoV-2 and help treat COVID-19. REGEN-COV moved from project initiation in early 2020 to the clinic in less than six months, ultimately receiving Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2020. Under a separate BARDA collaboration, Regeneron previously utilized the same antibody technologies to develop Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn), the first FDA-approved treatment for Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus). To help quell disease outbreaks, Regeneron and BARDA are continuing to work together to identify emerging or re-emerging pathogens and facilitate better treatments using Regeneron’s platform technologies for therapeutic development, preclinical research, and large-scale manufacturing. Director's Perspective: “During an infectious disease outbreak, rapidly developing and rolling out safe, effective, and targeted treatments is crucial,” said Dr. Robert Johnson, Director, Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division. “High-throughput antibody platform technologies can help to save lives and revolutionize the way we respond to health security threats. For example, we’ve worked with Regeneron to move from early research to an EUA of a COVID-19 therapeutic in a matter of months for use in the worst pandemic in a century. To date, approximately 150,000 doses have been shipped by partners across the U.S.” Locus Biosciences combats antibiotic-resistant E. coli with bacteriophages – Morrisville, NC × Locus Biosciences is developing an engineered bacteriophage therapy, LBP-EC01, to treat antibiotic-resistant E. coli that can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). Bacteriophages are viruses that only infect bacteria, and kill by lysing the cell. Utilizing CRISPR encoding technology, LBP-EC01 is designed to target E. coli that can often be antibiotic-resistant, providing an alternative treatment for patients with UTIs that are untreatable by commercial antibiotics. BARDA has partnered with Locus to develop this innovative treatment, which can help combat the threat of Antimicrobial Resistance. Director's Perspective: “The development of innovative therapeutics like bacteriophage to address antibiotic resistant infections will provide physicians a new tool to mitigate threats like E. coli, that impact public health and national preparedness,” said Christopher Houchens, Ph.D., director of BARDA’s Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical Countermeasures (CBRN) Program. “The prevalence of these infections within the community and hospitals places a substantial health and economic burden on our society, and will continue to do so if not adequately addressed. Supporting the development of innovative technologies like bacteriophages provides physicians alternatives to traditional small molecule therapeutics.” 98point6 – Text-based virtual care to assess, diagnose and treat COVID-19 – Seattle, WA × Initially developed as a data analytics tool for treating and reporting influenza, BARDA has worked with 98point6’s primary care telemedicine platform to expand screening and reporting of COVID-19. This tool combines their on-demand, text-based telemedicine services with automated COVID-19 screening via a questionnaire for patients experiencing fever or respiratory symptoms. 98point6 then creates daily and weekly reports of respiratory illness activity by zip code locations, which helps to identify near real-time hot spots as they are developing. Suspected COVID-19 patients then are directed to testing locations for confirmatory diagnostic testing. By combining early and rapid healthcare provider assessments with diagnostic antigen and viral testing for SARS-CoV-2, 98point6 can provide early indication of regional COVID-19 diagnosis rates. Director's Perspective: “During a pandemic, remotely providing early and actionable health information to patients, healthcare providers, emergency responders, and local public health organizations is critical to inform the health response. This is also true for anyone living in rural and remote areas,” said Dr. Sandeep Patel, director, BARDA Division of Research, Innovation and Ventures (DRIVe). “This partnership with 98point6 can fill that need, and achieve DRIVe’s goal to develop data analytics approaches to speed our public health response for emergencies. 98point6 can apply machine learning approaches that hospitals, pharmacies, testing sites, and even health departments could utilize to simplify and inform important decisions.” Cue Health – Portable Diagnostic Platform – San Deigo, CA × The Cue Health team is developing and expanding the Cue Health Monitoring System, an innovative, hand-held, portable diagnostic platform to deliver COVID-19 test results in about 20 minutes. The Monitoring System consists of a nasal swab and a cartridge-based reader that contain all of the reagents needed to detect SARS-CoV-2, without requiring a full laboratory environment. Under US FDA Emergency Use Authorization, these diagnostic tests can be administered by any authorized health care professional, and could be used in workplaces, schools and possibly even at home to rapidly test and identify individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The reusable, battery-operated Cue Cartridge Reader runs the Cue Test Cartridge and communicates results directly to the Cue Health App in under 20 minutes via a mobile smart device. The Cue Health App on the user’s mobile smart device is the user interface for test information, instructions, and display of test results. BARDA has partnered with Cue Health to develop this unique and versatile technology that may help accelerate COVID-19 screening and patient triage. Director's Perspective: “Widespread, rapid testing is crucial during a pandemic, but traditional molecular testing in a laboratory setting may take two to three days to complete,” said Rodney Wallace, Director, Detection, Diagnostics, and Device Infrastructure (DDDI) Division. “Having fast, portable, and accurate diagnostics to distribute to congregate care settings, institutions, and remote areas without nearby labs will be instrumental in curbing the spread of COVID-19 and the pandemic.” Vaxxas Vaccine Delivery System - Cambridge, MA × The Vaxxas platform is developing a high-density micro-array patch (HD-MAP), which administers a vaccine by applying a patch to the skin for a few seconds. It is designed to directly deposit the vaccine amongst a dense population of key immune cells in the skin for an efficient and effective immune response. HD-MAP technology has the potential to transform vaccine administration by enabling more doses to be available to more people, without requiring refrigeration. BARDA has partnered with Vaxxas to develop this innovative technology that could one day reduce the need for needles and syringes, and potentially be self-administered. Director's Perspective: “Saving lives in public health emergencies such as pandemics requires rapid, widespread vaccination among large populations, which poses logistical challenges,” said Dr. Robert Johnson, Director, Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division. “Imagine placing a patch on your arm or leg instead of going to a clinic or pharmacy to get a shot. Needle-free technology like the patch from Vaxxas will simplify future vaccination logistics and potentially lower costs, and a self-administered patch may also help improve vaccination rates.” Platelet Biogenesis Watertown, MA × BARDA has partnered with Platelet BioGenesis to develop novel platelet-like cells that are generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells using a patented process that mimics the conditions inside bone marrow, where platelets are naturally produced. This investment, which is funded by BARDA’s CBRN Radiation/Nuclear Program, includes GMP manufacturing scale-up and optimization and has the potential to include non-clinical and clinical studies. Director's Perspective: It is impossible to stockpile traditional donor platelets in the event of a mass casualty scenario. The current COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a significant decrease in blood collections, has only heightened the need to develop donor-independent solutions. Innovative technologies, such as Platelet BioGenesis’s, fit within the blood products portfolio of the CBRN division, which aims to ensure an adequate supply of blood products during a mass casualty, radiation, or nuclear incident. CYTOVALE SAN FRANCISCO, CA × Given limited critical care resources, there is a need to rapidly identify novel solutions to aid in triaging patients for care. BARDA has partnered with Cytovale, a company that is unmasking the immune system to provide insight into a patient’s status. They provide a novel engineering-based diagnostic, using machine learning, high-speed imaging and microfluidics allowing a patient’s cells to be interrogated in minutes and giving emergency care physicians additional information to make critical and time-sensitive decisions, such as whether to admit a patient or send them home. In resource-limited environments, as we see in some of the COVID-19 hotspots across the country, the IntelliSep test has potential to inform physician plans and improve patient outcomes. This diagnostic is currently being funded by BARDA’s Rapidly Deployable Capability to support activities needed for regulatory clearance. A Culture of Innovation At BARDA, we seek innovation in science and in the way we do business Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) Established: 2012 The CIADM program was established to strengthen the Nation’s capacity to produce drugs and vaccines during health emergencies. Each CIADM was established as a public-private partnership leveraging the innovative ideas of small biotech firms, the training expertise of academic institutions, and the development and manufacturing experience of large pharmaceutical companies. BARDA currently funds two Centers with long-term contracts, reflecting our long-term commitment to our industry partners and to our Nation’s capability to produce MCMs. Management and leadership of the CIADMs is provided through the National Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Partnership (BioMaP) jointly led by BARDA and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Through BioMaP, the CIADMs have constructed new or retrofitted existing facilities to utilize state-of-the-art, flexible, and innovative manufacturing platforms. Today, the CIADM facilities are capable of using modern cell- and recombinant-based technologies that can produce vaccines and therapeutics for not only pandemic influenza but also other threats more quickly and economically. BioMaP also works to enhance the Nation’s response capability through a unified, U.S. whole-of-government approach that supports the development of new drugs and vaccines, but also serve as a rapid turn-on switch that would function as surge capacity for the nation. Response to COVID-19: BARDA and BioMaP have leveraged our CIADM investment as part of USG comprehensive COVID-19 response effort.

Under an approximately $22 million, 3-year agreement between the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and Vaxxas – headquartered in Brisbane, Australia with offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts – the company will undertake U.S. and Australian Phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an easy-to-use, high-density micro-array patch (HD-MAP) and other development activities for the patch. “Protecting health and saving lives in public health emergencies such as pandemics often requires rapid, widespread vaccination among large groups of people, which poses multiple logistics challenges,” said BARDA Acting Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “Imagine placing a patch on your arm or leg instead of having to go to a clinic or doctor’s office to get a shot. Not only would needle-free technology simplify vaccination logistics and potentially lower costs, but a self-administered patch also may improve vaccination rates.” Micro-array patch technology has the potential to reduce the amount of vaccine required, which would help healthcare professionals provide vaccine to more people, an important consideration in a public health emergency. Patch technology also has the potential to offer a room-temperature-stable alternative to the cold chain required for some traditional vaccines, reducing the need for refrigeration in transport and storage. A room-temperature product that does not use traditional needles and syringes could possibly be provided directly to consumers who could administer the vaccine patch themselves. This technology could reduce the need for needles and syringes used for the majority of immunizations which may reduce the cost of vaccinations, and would simplify vaccine administration. The Phase 1 clinical trial, expected to start in 2022, will include more than 400 adult volunteers using unadjuvanted and adjuvanted (which includes an added agent to boost immune response) influenza vaccines. By using -pre-pandemic influenza vaccines for the clinical trials, the company more easily can determine the baseline immune response and safety of the micro-array technology, as well as the usability and acceptability of the technology. HD-MAP is the latest next-generation technology to receive BARDA development support and part of a growing pandemic preparedness and response portfolio.

As the pandemic began, our stakeholders and industry partners rallied with us to move essential medical countermeasures rapidly into development to combat what is now the most severe pandemic in a century. As the Acting BARDA Director and throughout my tenure at BARDA, I have been privileged to work alongside our dedicated BARDA staff, stakeholders and industry partners to address our country’s most important and pressing health security threats. This year our staff, stakeholders and industry partners went above and beyond offering technical solutions, and entering into novel collaborations to expand our nation’s medical countermeasure portfolio and enhance U.S. health security. Together we are making a difference and saving lives. All of our accomplishments are in partnership with our stakeholders and industry partners. With BARDA support, our industry collaborators this year have reached milestones of 55 FDA Approvals, Licensures, and Clearances since 2006; 15 diagnostic Emergency Use Authorizations for SARS-CoV-2 product candidates; over 3,800 market research submissions to the BARDA TechWatch/CoronaWatch program and 510 CoronaWatch meetings this year. These market research efforts enabled BARDA to invest over $15 Billion in COVID-19 funding, either directly or through our interagency partnerships. While COVID-19 may have had the spotlight, important work continued across traditional health security focus areas to prepare for pandemic influenza, CBRN threats, and innovation programs under DRIVe. These programs resulted in over 360 contracting actions and the investment of over $1.95 billion in funding. Eight months after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the U.S. we still face many challenges. I am confident that by working together, our interagency partners, stakeholders, industry partners, and our staff we will continue to rise to the occasion and end this pandemic. On behalf of the more than 280 contracting, program, and subject matter expert professionals who make up BARDA, we thank you. Your partnership and commitment to the mission are helping us save lives and protect Americans. I look forward to seeing you all virtually at BARDA Industry Day on October 27. Please remember to register so we can discuss together the important work ahead in FY2021. Thank you for your commitment, service, and dedication.

These doses will be available for patient care if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes use of the therapeutic, as outlined in agency guidance. “This agreement with Eli Lilly is part of Operation Warp Speed’s efforts to position the federal government to distribute potential therapeutics, allowing faster distribution if trials are successful,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “More good news about COVID-19 therapeutics is constantly emerging, and the Trump Administration’s commitment to supporting potentially lifesaving therapeutics will help deliver these products to American patients without a day’s delay.” The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command to provide $375 million for an initial purchase of 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab 700 mg from Lilly over the next two months. Under the agreement, the federal government can purchase up to 650,000 additional doses through the end of June 2021 for up to an additional $812.5 million. If the FDA authorizes use of the drug, the federal government will allocate the doses to state and territorial health departments which, in turn, will determine which healthcare facilities receive the intravenous (IV) infusion drug for use in outpatient care. These government-purchased doses would become available to the American people at no cost, although as is customary with such government-purchased products, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the medicine. Bamlanivimab currently is being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials funded by the company in addition to clinical trials as part of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership led by the National Institutes of Health with funding and other support from BARDA. ACTIV is part of a coordinated research strategy to prioritize and speed development of the most promising treatments and vaccines. FDA is reviewing bamlanivimab as a possible treatment for COVID-19 in outpatients. The monoclonal antibody used in the drug was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, which mimic the human immune system, are produced outside of the body by a single clone of cells or a cell line with identical antibody molecules and then delivered to patients by injection or infusion. The antibodies bind to certain proteins of a virus, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells.

Responding to President Trump’s call to develop 300 million doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by January under Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and AstraZeneca are collaborating to make available at least 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine called AZD1222, with the first doses delivered as early as October 2020. The agreement between AstraZeneca and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, will accelerate the development and manufacturing of the company’s investigational vaccine to begin Phase 3 clinical studies this summer with approximately 30,000 volunteers in the United States. Under this public-private partnership, BARDA can provide up to $1.2 billion to support, in parallel, advanced clinical studies, vaccine manufacturing technology transfer, process development, scaled-up manufacturing, and other development activities. Emergency use authorization or licensure of this vaccine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be required to make the vaccine available. Early milestones enable BARDA and AstraZeneca to determine how the program progresses forward. “This contract with AstraZeneca is a major milestone in Operation Warp Speed’s work toward a safe, effective, widely available vaccine by 2021,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Getting a vaccine to the American public as soon as possible is one part of President Trump’s multi-faceted strategy for safely reopening our country and bringing life back to normal, which is essential to Americans’ physical and mental well-being in so many ways. The Trump Administration is making multiple major investments in developing and manufacturing promising vaccines long before they’re approved so that a successful vaccine will reach the American people without a day wasted.” The AZD1222 vaccine candidate, which was developed by the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom and licensed to AstraZeneca, uses a vaccine platform technology which supports large-scale production. To speed vaccine development, AstraZeneca will advance its vaccine candidate into late-stage clinical studies in parallel with scaled manufacturing at BARDA’s Centers for Innovation and Advanced Development in Manufacturing (CIADM) in the United States. Working with the CIADMs enables development, technology transfer, and scaled-up manufacturing of the vaccine in the United States. A Phase 1/Phase 2 clinical study has been underway using the proposed technology in the United Kingdom since the end of April. AZD1222 is the fourth vaccine candidate to receive BARDA support for late-state development and manufacturing. BARDA continues to collaborate through Operation Warp Speed with other federal agencies and private industry to develop and make available vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests to combat COVID-19. To date, BARDA is supporting 31 medical products for the pandemic response; in addition to the four vaccine candidates, these products include seven treatments, 17 diagnostic tests, a test to screen donated blood for the virus, and two rapidly deployable technologies to aid health providers with early detection of sepsis in COVID-19 patients. About HHS, ASPR, and BARDA: HHS works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans, providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. The mission of ASPR is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st century health security threats.

Check out the Special Instructions from our BARDA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to see how you can commit to continuing the fight against #AntibioticResistance with us.","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Updated Instructions: Seeking Proposals: Antibacterial Accelerator Broad Agency Announcement Special Instructions WEB ANNOUNCEMENT Share In 2016, BARDA partnered with international funders to launch what would become the world’s largest early-stage research and development accelerator for new antibacterial products. The goal was to build a diverse, early-stage development portfolio of innovative products to treat, prevent, and diagnose antibiotic-resistant infections. The five-year program has exceeded the targets set out in the 2015-2020 U.S. National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB) (PDF - 519KB), supporting over 90 projects with 62 active within the portfolio, leading to nine first-in-human clinical studies. BARDA’s $180 million investment in the accelerator was met with an additional $300 million in funding and in-kind services from other donors, and over $1.94 billion in follow-on private sector investment in product developers. As the initial five-year program comes to a close, the 2020-2025 U.S. National Action Plan for CARB spells out the U.S. government’s commitment to continued support of early-stage development of innovative antibacterial products. Demonstrating that ongoing commitment, today we are launching a set of special instructions to the BARDA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals for another 10 years of investment through an Antibacterial Accelerator. This program will continue to be a platform for global partnerships, built on lessons learned over the last five years, to spur innovation and expand the pipeline of early-stage antibacterial candidates. With continued focus on supporting candidate programs to counter the threat of antimicrobial resistance now and in the future, the Antibacterial Accelerator will provide non-dilutive funding and a full suite of research and development support to product developers worldwide.

From investing in early innovation, to late stage development through U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, with each partnership, BARDA focuses on the end goal: ensuring products are available for the American people and the global community to protect health and save lives from a national security threat or other public health emergency. FDA approval, licensure, and clearance for medical countermeasures is a critical milestone for our partners and for BARDA and demonstrates the success of public-private partnerships in mitigating threats and creating a return on the public investment. That’s why we celebrate FDA approvals, licensures or clearances of medical countermeasures. At BARDA, we are excited about the news of the recent FDA approval of a Burn Care Therapeutic, StrataGraft (allogeneic cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in murine collagen – dsat) for the treatment of adults with thermal burns containing intact dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (deep partial thickness burns), from our partner Stratatech Corporation, a Mallinckrodt company. Designed with both dermal and epidermal layers composed of well-characterized human cells, StrataGraft is designed to deliver viable cells to support the body’s own ability to heal. BARDA and Stratatech partnered in 2015 to develop a new biological treatment pathway to improve healing outcomes in a mass casualty where burns are a medical consequence. The success of the program demonstrates an important advancement in the treatment of deep partial-thickness burns. Burn surgeons will now have a new biologic treatment to help eliminate or reduce the need for autografting. StrataGraft is applied in appropriate aseptic conditions, such as the operating room, and can be sutured, stapled or secured with a tissue adhesive. StrataGraft is cryopreserved in order to deliver viable cells upon application. In the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, 96% of the StrataGraft treated areas across all adult participants did not require autografting. From the development of the product in 2015 to the ultimate approval of StrataGraft in 2021, we are honored to be a part of this endeavor which may help make the world a healthier, safer place. For us, number approval #61 illustrates what government and industry can accomplish together. With novel medicines, diagnostics and vaccines we can save lives, protect the American people and enhance global health security. Visit our FDA Approval Page to learn more about our support aiding our partners in achieving the other 60 approvals. While obtaining FDA approval is a major milestone and symbol of development success, regulatory approval is not the end game for those of us in public health preparedness and response. Making sure those products are available when they’re needed is the real end game. Each approval offers an opportunity to recognize the collective and collaborative work of the scientific community, government partners and our industry partners to enhance national health security. Approval number 61 highlights just that, 15 years of public and private partnerships to counter health security threats. ...AND WE HAVE MORE IN THE PIPELINE Explore BARDA's CBRN and COVID-19 medical countermeasure portfolio to learn about other exciting products in the pipeline.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/newsroom/2020/siemens/","News release from HHS.gov: HHS Provides $25 Million to Siemens Healthineers to Develop and Produce COVID-19 Antigen Diagnostic Tests","Dual Contracts Will Yield Two New Antigen Tests and Update Massachusetts Facility to Produce up to 50 Million Tests Per Month","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA News release from HHS.gov: HHS Provides $25 Million to Siemens Healthineers to Develop and Produce COVID-19 Antigen Diagnostic Tests WEB ANNOUNCEMENT Share Dual Contracts Will Yield Two New Antigen Tests and Update Massachusetts Facility to Produce up to 50 Million Tests Per Month Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) awarded Siemens Healthineers a $12 million contract to support domestic production of two diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The funding is in addition to a $13 million HHS contract awarded Nov. 2 to enable the company to develop the tests. Combined, the two contracts represent another $25 million investment by the federal government to expand the types of tests for COVID-19 and to ensure that sufficient numbers of tests are available in the United States. The laboratory-based antigen tests under development will use a nose swab sample – or possibly a saliva sample – to detect viral antigens to determine whether a person is infected with the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 antigen (CoV2Ag) chemiluminescent immunoassay (IM) test kits will use Siemens' existing ADVIA Centaur XP and XPT platforms and Atellica IM platform. Siemens has over 2,000 fully automated immunoassay analyzing platforms in hospitals and mid-to-high volume reference laboratories across all 50 states. Siemens Healthineers will begin production after finalizing the new COVID-19 antigen tests if the Food and Drug Administration authorizes use of the tests. Today's contract will enable Siemens to purchase specialized equipment and modify its manufacturing facility in Walpole, MA, to safely ramp up production to 50 million tests per month within a few months. The development contract was awarded Nov. 2 by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Developmental Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). BARDA's development portfolio now includes more than 35 COVID-19 diagnostic tests, 16 of which have received FDA emergency use authorization. BARDA-supported partners have shipped more than 50 million tests to healthcare providers across the country. To support expansion of the company's domestic production through the Nov. 17 contract, BARDA collaborated with HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Department of Defense Assisted Acquisition Cell and the Department of the Air Force's Acquisition COVID-19 Task Force. BARDA funded both contracts under the Paycheck Protection and Health Care Enhancement Act. HHS works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans, providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. In addition to supporting companies and federal partners in ramping up U.S.-based production of COVID-19 testing, the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health leads America to healthier lives through promoting vaccination across the lifespan, developing the nation's report card for health (Healthy People 2030), ending America's HIV epidemic, preventing and treating substance use disorders, and improving the lives of all suffering health disparities, with a special emphasis on sickle cell disease. The mission of ASPR is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st century health security threats. Within ASPR, BARDA invests in the innovation, advanced research and development, acquisition, and manufacturing of medical countermeasures – vaccines, drugs, therapeutics, diagnostic tools, and non-pharmaceutical products needed to combat health security threats. To date, BARDA-supported products have achieved 56 FDA approvals, licensures or clearances.

Learn More PHEMCE IMPLEMENTATION Medical countermeasure policy and implementation development with the PHEMCE is coordinated by the Enterprise Senior Council, a body comprised of senior leadership from the PHEMCE agencies which serves as the decision forum for MCM development policy and implementation. Together, the PHEMCE organizations and agencies work to optimize the Nation's preparedness for public health emergencies in regards to the development, manufacturing, stockpiling, and administration of medical countermeasures. The PHEMCE mission components include: Requirements Setting Early Stage Research Advanced Development and Manufacturing Regulatory Science Management Procurement/Inventory Management/Stockpiling Response Planning, Policy, Guidance, and Communications Deployment/Distribution/ Dispensing/ Administration Monitoring/Evaluation/ Assessment In 2012, HHS released the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Strategy outlining the PHEMCE goals and objectives that will guide the policies and decisions of the partner agencies in regards to medical countermeasure capabilities that will enable our nation to have a nimble, flexible capacity to produce medical countermeasures rapidly in the face of any attack or threat. The 2012 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy establishes the goals and objectives that HHS will use to ensure that medical countermeasures are available for effective use against the highest priority CBRN threats facing the Nation. The accompanying 2012 PHEMCE Implementation Plan details those programs and initiatives throughout the Department that will be prioritized in pursuit of the goals and objectives presented in the strategy document. Both documents together constitute the blueprints the PHEMCE will follow in the near-, mid-, and long-terms to make the best use of available resources to contribute to national health security. REQUIREMENTS SETTING The requirements we set for medical countermeasure development and acquisition are critical to establishing programs to meet our preparedness goals. Medical countermeasure requirements in BARDA provide a solid foundation for establishing advanced development and acquisition programs that support the overarching ASPR mission and PHEMCE goals of reducing the adverse health effects of public health emergencies, including those caused by pandemic influenza, CBRN threat agents and emerging diseases.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/phemce/cdc/","CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC)",,"Skip to main content U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting public health activities in the United States. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) leads the emergency preparedness and response activities by providing strategic direction, support, and coordination for activities across CDC as well as with local, state, tribal, national, territorial, and international public health partners. CDC provides funding and technical assistance to states to build and strengthen public health capabilities. Ensuring that states can adequately respond to threats will result in greater health security; a critical component of overall U.S. national security. The CDC leads the procurement of medical countermeasures and their associated inventory management in the nation's Strategic National Stockpile (SNS ). The SNS is the Federal cache of pharmaceuticals, vaccines, medical supplies, equipment, and other items established to augment local supplies of critical medical countermeasures that may be needed for a public health emergency or disaster. The CDC and the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Response coordinate the development of Federal response plans and allocation strategies for medical countermeasures and assets in the SNS. The SNS is a national repository of antibiotics, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, life-support medications, IV administration, airway maintenance supplies, and medical/surgical items. The SNS has large quantities of medicine and medical supplies to protect the American public if there is a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.The SNS is designed to supplement and re-supply state and local public health agencies in the event of a national emergency anywhere and at anytime within the U.S. or its territories. SNS holdings are supplied to state and local jurisdictions at their request upon federal authorization. Once Federal and local authorities agree that the SNS is needed, medicines will be delivered to any state in the U.S. in time for them to be effective. Each state has plans to receive and distribute SNS medicine and medical supplies to local communities as quickly as possible. Biological Threats Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, can not. A number of agents to counter biological threats are included in the SNS, such as smallpox and anthrax vaccines. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC consider many factors, such as current biological threats, the availability of medical materiel, and the ease of dissemination of pharmaceuticals. One of the most significant factors in determining SNS composition, however, is the medical vulnerability of the U.S. civilian population. For more information, view the Bioterrorism page at the CDC website. Radiation Countermeasures CDC has a key role in protecting the public's health in an emergency involving the release of radiation that could harm people's health. Radiation can affect the body in a number of ways, and the adverse health effects of exposure may not be apparent for many years. These can range from mild effects, such as skin reddening, to serious effects such as cancer and death, depending on the amount of radiation absorbed by the body (the dose), the type of radiation, and how and for how long the person was exposed. Four drugs in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) are specifically designated for use in a radiation emergency. The first three drugs, potassium iodide, DTPA, and Prussian blue, may be used to treat internal contamination. Each countermeasure is specific, not only in the way it works, but also for the radioisotopes it is used to treat. Neupogen, the fourth countermeasure in the SNS, can be used to improve a victim's chances for survival by stimulasting certain types of cells that remain in the bone marrow to produce mature granulocytes -- white blood cells critical to fighting infection. For more information, view the Radiation Emergencies page at the CDC website. Chemical Emergencies A chemical emergency occurs when a hazardous chemical has been released and the release has the potential for harming people's health. Chemical releases can be unintentional, as in the case of an industrial accident, or intentional, as in the case of a terrorist attack. Some chemicals that are hazardous have been developed by military organizations for use in warfare. Examples are nerve agents such as sarin and VX, mustards such as sulfur mustards and nitrogen mustards, and choking agents such as phosgene. It might be possible for terrorists to get these chemical warfare agents and use them to harm people. Other hazardous chemicals are used in industry (for example, chlorine, ammonia, and benzene) or found in nature (for example, poisonous plants). Some could be made from everyday items such as household cleaners. These types of hazardous chemicals also could be obtained and used to harm people, or they could be accidentally released. For more information, view the Chemical Emergencies page at the CDC website. Influenza The CDC has continuing programmatic efforts in both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One hallmark of influenza viruses is that they are constantly changing. If a non-human (novel) influenza virus gains the ability for efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission and spreads globally, an influenza pandemic occurs. CDC's pandemic preparedness efforts include ongoing surveillance of human and animal influenza viruses, risk assessments of influenza viruses with pandemic potential, and the development and improvement of preparedness tools that can aid public health practitioners in the event of an influenza pandemic. For more information, view the Pandemic Influenza page at the CDC website.

This study is part of BARDA’s Rapidly Deployable Capabilities program to identify and pilot near term innovative solutions for identifying individuals who have COVID-19 infections. Individual and population-based data will be collated into computer models to improve “real-time” COVID-19 incidence prediction of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and enhance current disease surveillance systems to detect respiratory infections prior to the onset of symptoms. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is highly transmissible and is causing unprecedented social behavior changes in the country as many are being impacted by stay-at- home guidance’s from health officials. One of the biggest challenges with combating the virus is being able to detect those who are infected but either have not yet progressed to symptoms or will not show symptoms of the disease, as these individuals may be able to transmit without realizing it. In addition, the symptoms of COVID-19 appear to vary greatly in individuals and over the course of infection, and these will be correlated with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization. This project builds on Evidation’s current partnership with BARDA to monitor individuals for respiratory infections, such as influenza. This pilot study will demonstrate utility of empowering Americans with a novel means to self-monitor to improve health outcomes for COVID-19. The study will initiate with healthcare workers and first responders, who are our nation’s front-line responders, to more readily be diagnosed to prevent exposure to others. The study has the potential for large-scale deployment to allow Americans to determine risk of COVID-19 and to appropriately implement precautions against spread of COVID-19 and other such diseases.

BARDA is expanding a partnership with DiaSorin, Inc. to bring an additional COVID-19 test to market. In April 2020, BARDA supported the validation and submission of DiaSorin’s COVID-19 IgG serology test to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to use the test in U.S. laboratories. That test detects the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of a recently infected individual and can provide up to 170 test results per hour. Now that the company has obtained an EUA for their IgG assay, BARDA will support the validation and EUA submission for an IgM antibody test. Testing for both types of antibodies can be helpful given that SARS-CoV-2 infections can elicit IgM and IgG antibodies in infected individuals with variable timelines. DiaSorin’s IgG and IgM antibody tests run on their LIAISON® XL instrument platform. The test would be performed in hospital and reference diagnostic laboratories across the U.S. that currently have LIAISON ® XL instruments installed. This will increase the capability for testing to detect current or past infections by adding the detection of IgM antibodies to the existing capability of IgG antibody testing. Serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies allow people to know if they have been infected in the recent past, even if they never had symptoms. Research is still ongoing to determine whether these antibodies confer long-lasting protection against re-infection. As more information is learned about this, having a wide breadth of serology tests available in U.S. laboratories will enable a wider testing capability for the population. DiaSorin’s LIAISON® XL platform is FDA 510(k) cleared and is used routinely in clinical testing labs across the United States. The system is a fully automated, easy to use, detection platform that performs a range of immunodiagnostic assays. The platform consists of the automated LIAISON instrument and an immunodiagnostics assay workflow.

Novel technologies, medicines, diagnostics and vaccines can save lives, protect the American people and enhance global health security. The recent FDA approval of smallpox therapeutic TEMBEXA (brincidofovir), from partner Chimerix, Inc. signifies such a milestone in enhancing the Nation’s preparedness. TEMBEXA is an antiviral drug that inhibits activity of a critical viral enzyme, preventing the virus from replicating and causing disease. In February 2011, BARDA and Chimerix began collaborating and built on earlier work with other federal agencies to complete the activities - including advanced development and manufacturing of the therapeutic - required for the company to apply for FDA approval. Dr. Karl Hostetler, a professor of medicine from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, discovered the drug brincidofovir (TEMBEXA) and advanced it through early development at Chimerix, which he founded. The product benefitted from the early support of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Despite the successful eradication of smallpox worldwide by 1980, the demonstration that poxviruses can be synthesized de novo provides evidence that smallpox remains a significant threat; re-emergence of the virus, whether naturally occurring or intentional, would be devastating for people around the globe. The approval of TEMBEXA enhances the U.S. government’s preparedness to respond to a smallpox emergency, mitigate the risk of the virus developing drug resistance, and provide healthcare professionals with multiple options for therapeutic intervention to save lives in a smallpox emergency, which is in alignment with the Institute of Medicine’s recommendation to develop multiple therapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action against smallpox. From investing in early innovation, to late-stage development to achieve U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, BARDA focuses on the end goal: ensuring safe and effective products are made available to the American people and the global community to protect health and save lives from health security threats and other public health emergencies. FDA approval, licensure, and clearance for medical countermeasures is a critical milestone for BARDA and its interagency and private sector partners and demonstrates the strength of public-private partnerships in positioning the U.S. to mitigate health security threats through innovation, driving medical countermeasures from bench to bedside, and creating a return on the public investment. Scientists and other technical experts at BARDA are honored to be a part of this endeavor that helps make the world a healthier, safer place. For BARDA, approval number 60 illustrates what government and industry can accomplish together. Visit BARDA’s FDA approval page to learn more about the public-private partnerships that have achieved the other 59 approvals. While obtaining FDA approval is a major milestone and symbol of development success, regulatory approval is not the end game for public health preparedness and response. Making sure those products are available when needed is the real end game. Each approval offers an opportunity to recognize the collective and collaborative work of the scientific community, government partners and our industry partners to enhance national health security. Approval number 60 highlights just that, 15 years of public and private partnerships to counter health security threats. ...AND WE HAVE MORE IN THE PIPELINE Explore BARDA's CBRN and COVID-19 medical countermeasure portfolio to learn about other exciting products in the pipeline.

Created as public-private partnerships, the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (HHS CIADM) will provide a significant domestic infrastructure in the United States capable of producing medical countermeasures to protect Americans from the health impacts of bioterrorism as well as pandemic influenza and other disease in response to public health emergencies. The HHS CIADM program supports the country's advanced development activities for CBRN-related products and BARDA provides guidance and management oversight in terms of specific product objectives. The Centers will help to support and develop the next generation of the medical countermeasure development workforce through training opportunities for current and future industry and government scientists who engage in advanced development and manufacturing of medical countermeasures. Finally, in public health emergencies, these Centers may augment existing United States manufacturing surge capacity against emerging infectious diseases or unknown threats, including pandemic influenza. The HHS CIADMs were created through a public-private partnership model, bringing together the innovative ideas of small biotech firms, the training expertise of academic institutions, and the development and manufacturing experience of large pharmaceutical companies. This helps to ensure a sustainable domestic medical countermeasure infrastructure with unprecedented ability to accelerate development and manufacture medical countermeasures in time of need. These Centers will also be used to explore emerging and innovative technologies that could be applied to current or future medical countermeasure development efforts to reduce risk, increase yield, and ultimately to reduce total life-cycle costs through flexible manufacturing, consolidating other costly product development expenditures, or any other economy-of-scale opportunities. To date BARDA has funded three Centers with contracts capable of renewal for up to 25 years, representing a long-term commitment to this partnership with industry and to national security. Under these contracts, the HHS CIADM performers will retrofit existing facilities, or build new facilities to incorporate flexible, innovative manufacturing platforms that can be used to manufacture multiple products. These facilities will be capable of using modern cell- and recombinant-based vaccine technologies that have the potential to produce vaccines for not only pandemic influenza but also other threats more quickly and economically. Emergent Manufacturing Operations Baltimore LLC, with facilities in Baltimore and Gaithersburg, MD, will lead one Center, working with a network of partners; Michigan State University, Kettering University of Flint, Michigan, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore. This contract is for approximately $163 million over the first eight years. More Information (HTML) Novartis Vaccines Division will head a second Center, leveraging existing public-private investments by HHS in a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility in Holly Springs, NC, and working with North Carolina State University and Duke University. The Novartis contract is valued at approximately $60 million over the first four years. More Information (PDF 60KB) Texas A&M University System will lead a third Center collaborating with GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines of Marietta, PA, Kalon Biotherapeutics of College Station, TX, and their extensive network of institutes. This contract is valued at approximately $176 million over the first five years. More Informantion (HTML) Establishing the centers achieves a core recommendation cited in the 2010 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise Review; a comprehensive, government-wide review called for by Secretary Sebelius to address challenges encountered in developing biodefense medical countermeasures. These centers also address concerns raised by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in the August 2010 Report to the President on Reengineering the Influenza Vaccine Production Enterprise to Meet the Challenges of Pandemic Influenza, which called for flexible, nimble, and modern vaccine manufacturing technologies.

This latest agreement brings the total supply of casirivimab and imdevimab purchased by HHS and DOD to over 1.5 million treatment courses. Under the agreement announced in July to meet Operation Warp Speed goals, Regeneron is in the process of delivering the first approximately 300,000 doses of casirivimab and imdevimab. Following Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), HHS began allocating these doses November 23 to state and territorial health departments which, in turn, direct which healthcare facilities receive the infusion drug. An HHS treatment locator is now available showing where antibody therapeutics have been delivered. “With COVID-19 cases continuing to rise, treating people with mild or moderate infections can help prevent hospitalizations, which will reduce the burden on healthcare systems,” said HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Robert Kadlec, M.D. “To ensure equitable and efficient distribution, we will continue coordinating with state and territorial health departments to get these additional therapeutics into the hands of healthcare providers quickly, with a focus on areas of the country currently hardest hit by the pandemic.” Allocations to state and territorial health departments are based proportionally on confirmed COVID-19 cases in each state and territory over the previous seven days, based on data that hospitals and state health departments enter into the HHS Protect data collection platform. To date, the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has allocated more than 127,700 treatment courses of the therapeutic. These government-purchased doses are available at no cost to patients, although healthcare facilities could charge for administering the medicine – as is customary with such government-purchased products. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of ASPR, provided approximately $2.63 billion to purchase the additional treatment courses, working in collaboration with the DOD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) and the Army Contracting Command. Regeneron’s therapeutic treatment received an EUA from the FDA on November 21, 2020, for use in treating high-risk, non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate confirmed cases of COVID-19. Regeneron developed the treatment, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies called casirivimab and imdevimab, with preclinical and clinical development funded in part through a long-standing partnership with BARDA. Regeneron previously used its same proprietary technology to develop a novel triple monoclonal antibody treatment for Ebola, which in 2020 became the first FDA-approved treatment for Zaire ebolavirus. Antibodies are a component of the human immune system. Monoclonal antibodies developed by Regeneron are made outside of the body by a single clone of cells or a cell line producing identical antibody molecules, and then delivered to patients via infusion or injection. The antibodies bind to certain proteins of a virus, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. To find out how much of the therapeutic treatment has been allocated to specific states, territories and jurisdictions, visit the allocation dashboard. This dashboard will be updated after each allocation while the U.S. government is engaged in the allocation and distribution process. About Operation Warp Speed (OWS): OWS is a partnership among components of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, engaging with private firms and other federal agencies, and coordinating among existing HHS-wide efforts to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

The orders placed today bring the vaccine purchased by the U.S. government from these two companies to a total of 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate 300 million people. Each company is delivering 300 million doses in regular increments through the end of July 2021. Each company will leverage U.S.-based manufacturing capacity to fill, finish and ship vials as the bulk material is produced.” “As the President directed, we are expanding our supply of COVID vaccines to protect people as quickly as possible,” said Acting HHS Secretary Norris Cochran. “These purchases will allow us to accelerate our vaccination efforts to get shots into the arms of the American people. While we rapidly ramp up the pace of vaccinations, I encourage everyone to take actions now to protect themselves and their families: wear a mask, wash your hands often, and practice physical distancing.” The companies began manufacturing doses of their vaccines at the same time that clinical trials were getting underway last year. Beginning the complex process of scaling up to large-scale manufacturing in parallel with clinical trials expedited the traditional vaccine development timeline so that initial doses could begin shipping when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization. The vaccine is available at no cost. Vaccine administration costs for private-sector administration partners are being covered by healthcare payers: private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, and an HHS program to cover COVID-19 costs for the uninsured which is reimbursing providers at Medicare rates from the Provider Relief Fund. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DOD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) and Army Contracting Command to provide approximately $2 billion for the additional doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, bringing the total purchase from Pfizer to approximately $6 billion. BARDA, JPEO-CBRND and Army Contracting Command also collaborated to provide up to approximately $1.65 billion to Moderna, bringing the total federal investment in Moderna’s vaccine development, clinical trials, manufacturing and purchase to approximately $5.75 billion. Moderna’s vaccine was co-developed with scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with NIAID also supporting the vaccine’s nonclinical studies and clinical trials. BARDA supported phase 2/3 clinical trials, vaccine manufacturing scale up and other development activities for this vaccine. Moderna’s Phase 3 clinical trial began July 27 as the first government-funded Phase 3 clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and enrolled approximately 30,000 adult volunteers who did not have COVID-19. An independent data safety monitoring board overseeing the Phase 3 clinical trial reviewed the trial data and concluded that the vaccine was safe, prevented disease in 94 percent of the volunteers who received the vaccine, reduced the severity of illness in the small percentage of volunteers who contracted COVID-19, and was generally well tolerated. The Phase 3 clinical trial for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine enrolled approximately 43,000 adult volunteers in the U.S. who did not have COVID-19. The clinical trial showed that the vaccine was safe, prevented disease in approximately 95 percent of the volunteers who received the vaccine, reduced the severity of illness in the five percent of volunteers who contracted COVID-19 and was generally well-tolerated. The clinical studies of both vaccines are ongoing to gather additional data such as the vaccines’ efficacy in younger populations, the duration of immunity after vaccination, and the impact of vaccination on transmissibility of the virus. Messenger RNA vaccines take advantage of the process that cells use to make proteins in order to trigger an immune response and build immunity to a virus. In contrast, most vaccines use weakened or inactivated versions or components of a disease-causing virus to stimulate the body’s immune response to create antibodies. HHS and DOD have contracted with four other companies to expedite development and production of vaccines that use a variety of vaccine platform technologies and are manufacturing COVID-19 vaccine doses while clinical trials are underway. If any of these other vaccine candidates are authorized by the FDA for emergency use, HHS and DOD can negotiate agreements with the respective companies to purchase additional vaccine doses to meet the demand in the United States.

The contest taps into the nation's creativity and entrepreneurial spirit to help curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. “We know that properly and consistently worn face masks help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections, but many people are reluctant to wear them for a variety of reasons,” said Nikki Bratcher-Bowman, HHS acting Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). “With this mask challenge, we want to get people across the country involved in developing new masks that are both effective and comfortable. This will help us control COVID-19 and be better prepared for future public health emergencies.” Common reasons for not wearing a mask or not wearing a mask tightly over the nose and mouth include breathability, comfort, uncertainty about effectiveness, and fogged glasses; people in the disability community also have expressed concerns such as the inability to read facial expressions, difficulty speaking through the face covering, and difficulty finding masks to fit facial features. Within ASPR, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is collaborating with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the personal use mask design challenge. NIOSH administers the nation’s respirator approval program. The first phase of the challenge, which opens today, invites new mask designs that meet specific criteria and asks the submitter to describe how that design idea fits the criteria and solves the hurdles to mask wearing. Up to 10 winning ideas will be selected to split $100,000. Submissions are due by 5 p.m. EDT April 21, 2021. In the second phase of the challenge, contest participants submit prototypes that leverage research on the filtration efficiency of materials and meet the criteria including filtration, fit, comfort, and how easily the design can be manufactured on large scale. NIOSH and partner labs will test how well the prototypes meet filtration and airflow resistance criteria (as applicable to the designs). Up to five winning prototypes will split $400,000. Winners also will be provided access to BARDA’s scientific expertise to complete development of the prototype. Mask designs cannot use prophylactic chemical treatments, such as sprays or drugs that are inhaled or absorbed through the skin, nose, or mouth, to achieve their protective effects. Also excluded are contract tracing apps and other behavioral change protocols, self-contained breathing apparatus or supplied air design, accessories or modifications to NIOSH-approved respirators or FDA-approved surgical masks, such as additional filters, or modifying the head straps or ear loops. Winners must be U.S. citizens or legal residents or U.S.-owned businesses operating in the United States. Contest rules, including eligibility, criteria for winning entries and how to submit a design, are available on Challenge.gov. Share Last Updated: March 31, 2021 Share this article now!

The strategy seeks to “establish domestic production capacity and a stockpile of countermeasures to ensure sufficient vaccine to vaccinate front-line personnel and at-risk populations”. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza: Implementation Plan (2006) further defines 'establishment and maintenance of stockpiles of pre-pandemic influenza vaccine adequate to immunize 20 million persons against influenza strains that present a pandemic threat' to be a key capability needed for an effective pandemic response. BARDA's Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpiling Program provides preparedness for influenza pandemics maintains stockpiles of influenza vaccine antigens and adjuvants. The Program utilizes the HHS Influenza Risk Assessment Tool to identify and evaluate potential pandemic influenza virus threats. Informed by these results, BARDA implements measured responses from development of candidate vaccine viruses, virus 'seeds', clinical investigational lot production, clinical safety and immunogenicity trials, to commercial scale vaccine manufacturing for stockpiling. The quality of stockpiled vaccines is routinely evaluated through vaccine potency assays as part of master stability programs at the vaccine manufacturers that store the stockpiled vaccines, and laboratory assays that measure the cross- reactivity of sera from animals and humans immunized with the stockpiled vaccines against previous and circulating influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Clinical studies started in 2015 to evaluate the immunity afforded by old and new stockpiled vaccines. The results from all of these studies continuously shape the vaccine stockpile so that it continues to provide efficient and broadly effective protection against a potential pandemic. BARDA maintains the pre-pandemic influenza vaccine stockpiles through public-private partnerships with domestic influenza vaccine manufacturers using egg- and cell-based vaccine and new oil-in-water adjuvant technologies. BARDA-industry partnerships proved vital during the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic when H1N1 monovalent vaccine was made available to meet U.S. demand. Together with its partners, BARDA has stockpiled hundreds of millions of doses of pre-pandemic H5N1 bulk vaccine covering several virus variants since 2005, and tens of millions of doses of H7N9 vaccine since 2013. BARDA also maintains a library of vaccine virus production 'seeds' to address lower-risk pre-pandemic threats. BARDA's Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile Program will continue to sustain and expand the dynamic pre-pandemic influenza vaccine stockpile using modern vaccine technologies and stay ready for pandemic responses with vaccine manufacturers and the capabilities of BARDA's Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. Industry partners are encouraged to visit the BARDA Broad Agency Announcement and sign up for a BARDA TechWatch meeting.

Vaccination is critical for the reduction of infection rates, severity of disease and mortality due to COVID-19.The Moderna mRNA vaccine platform is rapid and scalable and early clinical trials have already begun with support by NIH. Moderna will advance the vaccine candidate into expanded clinical studies to extend the size of the safety data base. The cumulative safety dataset generated in early clinical trials is expected to be sufficient to advance the vaccine. A pivotal advanced stage clinical study will be conducted in approximately 10,000 subjects. The feasibility of a clinical efficacy study for licensure is dependent on the incidence of COVID-19 and will require discussion with global health and regulatory authorities. If current rates of transmission are sustained, a clinical study of the proposed size could be sufficient to demonstrate efficacy. Moderna’s manufacturing facility in Norwood, Massachusetts has the capacity to develop mRNA-formulated lipid nanoparticles (fLNPs), the vaccine delivery system, through product launch. Parallel activities will be undertaken to expand vaccine production in the United States in preparation for large scale production as soon as the vaccine has met regulatory requirements.

BARDA and Philips North America are collaborating to expand the capability of the compact Philips Lumify - an app-based hand-held ultrasound system - with predictive machine-learning (ML) algorithms to provide real-time analysis. BARDA is supporting the point-of-care ultrasound device to achieve 510(k) clearance for lung imaging to enable early and accurate detection and diagnosis of patients with smoke inhalation injury and viral pneumonia, including COVID-19. Development of this multifunctional system supports three independent needs that BARDA identified in collaboration with partners at the American Burn Association and the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. These efforts will focus on: 1) advanced development of a next generation ultrasound for lung imaging, 2) focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exams, and 3) detection of compartment syndrome – a painful condition that occurs when pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels. BARDA aims to transform routine care with medical countermeasure technologies so that they can be used easily in responding to disease outbreaks and mass casualty incidents. Philips also will develop a novel 3D-ultrasound transducer for use in the ML-based FAST exam (effort #2 above) for rapid, automated diagnostic screening of patients with abdominal trauma. These technical advances will allow faster and better delivery of care as well as expand the trained user base. In addition, the envisioned ultrasound technology aims to transform the current standard of care in the diagnosis of acute compartment syndromes of the extremities. BARDA will continue to model and evaluate the cost-effectiveness impact, and ensure value generation from these new transformative MCM technologies.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/phemce/requirements-setting/","MedicalCountermeaures.gov - Home","Your description","Skip to main content Public Health Emergency U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Medical Countermeasures Search Submit Login Register Home PHEMCE Requirements Setting Requirements Setting Medical countermeasure requirements in BARDA provide a solid foundation for establishing advanced development and acquisition programs that support the overarching ASPR mission of reducing the adverse health effects of public health emergencies, including those caused by pandemic influenza, CBRN threat agents and emerging diseases. The requirements we set for medical countermeasure development and acquisition are critical to establishing programs to meet our preparedness goals. Our stated requirements also create incentives for industry participation and shape the market for countermeasure products. Transparency in the process for establishing medical countermeasure requirements will remain a top priority for BARDA, as will be the communication of those requirements to product developers and end users. Requirements for medical countermeasures for CBRN threats are defined with input from stakeholders across the federal government within the structure of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). Once established, these requirements drive BARDA advanced development and acquisition programs, as well as research, development, and acquisition efforts in HHS. CBRN medical countermeasure requirements are consistent with the planning and prioritization expressed in the HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan. Pandemic Influenza requirements are defined by strategic objectives established in the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan (November 2005). Threat Assessments: Setting medical countermeasure requirements begins by defining the scenarios that inform our preparedness and response planning. For Pandemic Influenza, the Pandemic Severity Index serves this purpose. For CBRN threats, the Department of Homeland Security identifies threats of particular concern by issuing Material Threat Determinations (MTDs), and Population Threat Assessments (PTAs). Each PTA defines plausible, high consequence scenarios which include estimates of the number of people who would be exposed to the threat. The BARDA Division of Analytical Support provides extensive support for determination of the needs, gaps, and effects of medical countermeasure portfolio packages to mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with anthrax, smallpox, pandemic influenza, and other threats. Medical and Public Health Consequence Assessments: The modeling team at BARDA supports the PHEMCE decision-making process by conducting medical and public health consequence modeling to estimate the potential public health impact of PTA-class events. The resulting morbidity and mortality projections are then used to help to determine the appropriate strategies for mitigating adverse health effects, and to estimate the types and quantities of medical countermeasures that would be required. Requirements Documents: Medical countermeasure requirements are established through four central documents that each address particular needs for portfolio planning. Threat-Specific White Paper: Provides scientific background on the threat agent and the resulting adverse health effects of exposure. Scenario-Based Requirements Paper: Defines the current medical treatment for exposure to the given threat agent, and establishes the types and quantities of medical countermeasures that will be required during a medical and public health response to an event similar to the one described in the Population Threat Assessment. Utilization Policy: Establishes the relative roles of the medical countermeasures defined above before, during, and following a PTA-sized event. This includes consideration of pre-event use, prioritization of scarce resources during an event, standards of care during a mass casualty response, and pre-positioning of medical countermeasures. Product-Specific Requirements Paper: Provides a specific description of the minimum acceptable and ideal characteristics of a desired medical countermeasure, including details such as dosage form, shelf life, and storage conditions. Medical countermeasure requirements are then established based on the answers to key questions: Medical Countermeasure Types: What types of medical countermeasures (e.g., vaccines, drugs for prophylaxis, and drugs for treatment) or other interventions could mitigate adverse health effects based on the severity of illness? Additional modeling can be especially helpful when multiple medical countermeasure types may be available, and the relative effectiveness of an array of medical countermeasure strategies can be evaluated. Scale: How many medical countermeasures are needed? Answers to this question are dependent on threat-specific strategies for prophylaxis and therapy. Medical Countermeasure Characteristics: What product-specific characteristics of the medical countermeasure would facilitate an effective public health and medical response to a mass casualty event? This Target Product Profile (TPP) could include desired indications, formulations, dosing, delivery mechanisms, packaging, storage and transport, shelf life, or other considerations. What is the priority for use of a medical countermeasure?

The material threat determination for botulinum toxin (botulism) was issued in June 2004. The goal of BARDA’s Botulinum Program is to develop a single product that is effective against all seven known serotypes of botulinum toxin, which addresses a significant gap in preparedness for this biothreat and public health concern. Development of a heptavalent botulinum antitoxin supports the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHECME) and BARDA strategic goals of developing countermeasures for “at-risk” individuals. This program was one of the first supported under Project BioShield (PBS). BARDA has provided PBS funds to support the late stage development and procurement of a heptavalent botulinum antitoxin (HBAT) produced in hyperimmune horses. The HBAT product was licensed under the Animal Rule by the FDA in March 2013, becoming the second product supported under PBS to achieve this milestone. HBAT is the only licensed botulinum antitoxin available and is effective against all seven known serotypes. The product has been used to treat over 150 cases of naturally occurring cases of botulinum intoxication in infants and others. Under the BARDA program, the PHEMCE has achieved the goal of developing and delivering a product to the Strategic Nation Stockpile (SNS) to address the threat of botulism. In addition, BARDA has delayed additional deliveries to maintain preparedness levels at, or above, the requirement through 2025. BARDA has provided additional PBS funds to collect enough plasma to manufacture additional treatment courses of the product. The plasma is stored at the manufacturer in a BARDA-controlled facility and can be manufactured into the final product to replace expiring product currently held in the SNS. BARDA anticipates initiating a project to maintain its herd of hyper-immune horses, which have taken millions of dollars over and several years to generate and maintain as part of the botulism preparedness and response effort. The Botulinum Program’s future efforts will include fulfilling the Phase IV post-marketing commitments and requirements under licensure of the HBAT product, rather than making additional investments in other candidate products. These long-term strategies will maintain current preparedness levels to protect Americans from botulism for the next decade.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) collaborated to purchase 100,000 treatment courses of a second therapeutic treatment from Eli Lilly and Company. This treatment uses two monoclonal antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, to treat non-hospitalized, high-risk COVID-19 patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for Lilly’s therapeutic of bamlanivimab and etesevimab on February 9, 2021. The treatment is administered through an intravenous (IV) infusion and is intended for non-hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms and are at high-risk for severe symptoms and hospitalization. The treatment uses a single dose for each patient. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), collaborated with the DOD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) and the Army Contracting Command to provide $210 million for the initial purchase of up to 100,000 treatment courses of the bamlanivimab and etesevimab therapeutic. The agreement includes flexibility to purchase additional treatment courses as needed, up to a total of 1.2 million, through November 2021. The recently authorized antibody therapeutic adds to the list of products available in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, including Lilly’s single monoclonal antibody therapy, bamlanivimab, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ therapeutic that uses casirivimab and imdevimab. Both therapeutics received emergency use authorization in November 2020. “For COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of developing severe infections and being hospitalized, being treated while their symptoms are mild or moderate can help prevent hospitalizations, which means better results for patients and a reduced strain on healthcare systems and their staffs,” said BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “The monoclonal antibody therapeutics are readily available, and ASPR is working with state and territorial health departments to get these therapeutics into the hands of healthcare providers across the country.” To receive an antibody therapeutic treatment, patients should contact their healthcare providers. To help states and territories identify and allocate the treatment courses to non-hospital facilities that serve priority and underserved populations, HHS initiated a Special Projects for Equitable and Efficient Distribution (SPEED) program. Eligible facilities include nursing homes, assisted living facilities, federally qualified health centers, correctional facilities, dialysis centers, and other healthcare settings. HHS also implemented a direct ordering system for healthcare facilities to order any of the available therapeutics, and all three remain free of charge to receiving sites. To help patients and healthcare providers find possible treatment locations for any of the available antibody therapeutic treatments, HHS created a treatment locator that provides information on where the medicines have been delivered. Lilly developed the bamlanivimab and etesevimab treatment without federal support. The two monoclonal antibodies that make up the combination therapeutic were identified from blood samples taken from patients who recovered from COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, which mimic the human immune response, are produced outside of the body by a single clone of cells or a cell line with identical antibody molecules and then delivered to patients by infusion. The antibodies bind to certain proteins of a virus, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. In issuing EUAs for the monoclonal antibody therapeutics, FDA noted the potential for adverse events or side effects of bamlanivimab alone or when administered with etesevimab and in administering Regeneron’s casirivimab and imdevimab. About HHS, ASPR, and BARDA HHS works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans, providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. The mission of ASPR is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st century health security threats.

Under Project BioShield, the U.S. Government seeks to make balanced acquisitions of the most urgently needed medical countermeasures, within the constraints of the budget. In support of this goal, the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) is responsible for coordinating the research, development, procurement, stockpiling, and deployment of medical countermeasures needed to protect the public in the event of a public health emergency. Mission areas include: Defining and prioritizing requirements for public health emergency medical countermeasures Focusing research, development, and procurement activities on the identified requirements Establishing deployment and response strategies for medical countermeasures in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). HHS works in close collaboration with key partners, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. HHS also works to promote open communication of U.S. Government needs to industry, an essential partner in Project BioShield. The availability of a substantial, long- term funding source was designed to provide the incentive for industry to respond to U.S. Government requirements and develop critical medical countermeasures for the American public. Since the enactment of the Project BioShield, BARDA has awarded numerous contracts for late-stage development and acquisition of CBRN medical countermeasures. Medical countermeasures have been procured thus far under Project BioShield include anthrax vaccine, two anthrax antitoxins, a botulinum antitoxin, a smallpox vaccine for immunocompromised individuals, and radionucleotide chelators (liquid potassium iodide for pediatric use and Ca++ and Zn++ DTPA). Other medical countermeasures of interest for procurement under Project Bioshield in the near future are for treatment of acute radiation syndrome associated neutropenia, chemical threats and radiation-induced thermal burns.

If authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use as outlined in agency guidance, doses of the vaccine will begin shipping immediately. The vaccine would be provided at no cost to Americans. Vaccine administration costs for private-sector administration partners will be covered by healthcare payers: private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, and an HHS program to cover COVID-19 costs for the uninsured which is reimbursing the provider at Medicare rates from the provider relief fund. Under the agreement, Moderna will leverage its U.S.-based manufacturing capacity to fill, finish and ship vials of mRNA-1273 as the bulk material is produced. The additional doses ordered today provide for continuous delivery through the end of June 2021. This strategy will help meet the anticipated demand for mRNA-1273 and safely accelerate the delivery schedule for all 200 million doses the U.S. government is purchasing. “Securing another 100 million doses from Moderna by June 2021 further expands our supply of doses across the Operation Warp Speed portfolio of vaccines,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “This new federal purchase can give Americans even greater confidence we will have enough supply to vaccinate all Americans who want it by the second quarter of 2021.” The purchase announced today brings the total doses of mRNA-1273 owned by the federal government to 200 million. Moderna began manufacturing the first 100 million doses while clinical trials were getting underway. Manufacturing in parallel with clinical trials expedited the traditional vaccine development timeline and built toward the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed goal to begin delivering safe and effective vaccines to the American people by the end of the year. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, has now collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command to provide up to approximately $3.2 billion to expand the manufacturing capacity reserved for mRNA-1273 and to deliver the vaccine doses to government-designated locations across the country. This federal funding brings the total provided to Moderna for this vaccine, including vaccine development, clinical trials and manufacturing, to $4.1 billion. The government also has the option to acquire up to an additional 300 million doses of the Moderna vaccine. The vaccine candidate was co-developed by Moderna and scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with NIAID also supporting the vaccine’s nonclinical studies and clinical trials. BARDA supported phase 2/3 clinical trials, vaccine manufacturing scale up and other development activities for this vaccine. The Phase 3 clinical trial, which began July 27, was the first government-funded Phase 3 clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and enrolled approximately 30,000 adult volunteers who did not have COVID-19. An independent data safety monitoring board overseeing the Phase 3 clinical trial reviewed the trial data and concluded that the vaccine was safe, prevented disease in 94 percent of the volunteers who received the vaccine and was generally well tolerated. The clinical studies are ongoing. Moderna is the second company to apply for FDA emergency use authorization of a coronavirus vaccine that uses messenger RNA (mRNA), and FDA has scheduled a Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting Dec. 17 to review the company’s request. Messenger RNA vaccines take advantage of the process that cells use to make proteins in order to trigger an immune response and build immunity to a virus. In contrast, most vaccines use weakened or inactivated versions or components of a disease-causing virus to stimulate the body’s immune response to create antibodies. Under Operation Warp Speed, federal partners are working with multiple companies – Moderna, Pfizer, Janssen (Johnson&Johnson), AstraZeneca, Novavax, and Sanofi in collaboration with GSK – to develop vaccines that use a variety of vaccine platform technologies and manufacture the COVID-19 vaccine doses while clinical trials are underway. If any of these vaccine candidates are authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, as outlined in agency guidance, HHS and DOD can negotiate agreements with the respective companies to purchase enough vaccine to meet demand in the United States.

Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest global health threats of our time. Antibiotics are vital tools for addressing bacterial infections and save untold millions of lives each year. However, the increasing prevalence of resistant strains of bacteria threatens the usefulness of antibiotics and can cause untreatable infections. CDC’s 2019 Report on Antibiotic Resistance Threats estimates that each year, more than 2.8 million Americans develop a drug-resistant infection, and more than 35,000 die from them. Globally, drug-resistant infections kill over 700,000 people every year, and in the United Nations’ report No Time to Wait, warns that without a sustained effort to contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR), this figure could increase to 10 million lives lost per year by 2050, with 2.4 million deaths occurring in high-income countries between 2015 and 2050. The U.S. government is committed to fostering partnerships that work to increase the pipeline of urgently needed new antimicrobial products. In 2016, BARDA co-founded the biopharmaceutical accelerator CARB-X, to deliver high-impact technologies to combat the AMR threat. The CARB-X program was conceptualized, developed, and launched with support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Wellcome Trust, and is managed by Boston University. Today, with additional support from the UK’s Global AMR Innovation Fund, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CARB-X has become one of the world’s largest public-private partnerships focused on preclinical development of new antibacterial products. Since its inception, CARB-X has provided funding, technical guidance, and business support to 75 diverse and innovative projects in 10 countries to develop innovative antibacterial therapeutics, vaccines, rapid diagnostics, and other life-saving products. Several projects have successfully met early milestones to date and are poised to increase the pipeline of antibacterial products and respond to the AMR global threat. BARDA remains dedicated to promoting innovation to save lives and combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Visit GHTC’s Innovating for Impact Awards page and the CARB-X website to learn more.

The goal of AstraZeneca’s partnership with the U.S. Government is to develop a monoclonal antibody cocktail that can help prevent infection. An effective monoclonal antibody that can prevent COVID-19, particularly one that is long-lasting and delivered by intramuscular injection, may be of particular use in certain groups. This includes people who have compromised immune function, those who are over 80 years old, and people undergoing medical treatments that preclude them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. If the FDA authorizes use of AZD7442 for prevention of SARS-CoV-2, as outlined in agency guidance, the federal government will distribute the doses at no cost. As is customary with government-purchased medical products, healthcare professionals could charge for the cost of administering the product. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command, to provide approximately $486 million to AstraZeneca for two Phase 3 clinical trials and related development activities, including a large-scale manufacturing demonstration project and supply of AZD7442 doses in the United States. One of the Phase 3 clinical trials of AZD7442 will evaluate safety and efficacy of the product to prevent infection for up to 12 months in approximately 5,000 volunteers. An additional Phase 3 clinical study will evaluate if AZD7442 can help prevent infection in people who have come in contact with someone with COVID-19 in a post-exposure prophylaxis setting. This second study will enroll approximately 1,100 volunteers. The company estimates 100,000 doses of AZD 7442 could be available from this project for the nation’s high-risk population that may not benefit from a vaccine by December 2020. “In addition to Operation Warp Speed’s historic progress on vaccines, we are supporting promising monoclonal antibodies for prevention and treatment all the way through to supply, allowing faster distribution if trials are successful,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “More good news about COVID-19 treatments is constantly emerging, and President Trump’s commitment to supporting lifesaving measures, like AstraZeneca’s antibody candidate which may help deliver these products to our nation’s most vulnerable populations.” Working in parallel across clinical development and manufacturing supply will accelerate the traditional product development timeline, should clinical trials prove successful and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorize use of the medicine. AZD7442 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies discovered by Vanderbilt University, licensed to AstraZeneca and modified using AstraZeneca’s proprietary half-life extension technology to extend their duration of action (the amount of time that the antibodies remain in the body). Monoclonal antibodies synthesized in the laboratory aim to mimic natural antibodies and are delivered by injection or infusion. The antibodies bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. The long-acting monoclonal antibody combination neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2, and has the potential to increase effectiveness and durability of the prevention of infection. Preclinical and clinical development for this antiviral has been supported in part through an existing partnership among BARDA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Vanderbilt University and AstraZeneca.

Even though our hospital provides more than adequate PPE, the possibility of contracting COVID remains significant, and recently happened to me. I hope telling my story will benefit others and inspire efforts to develop better treatments for this treacherous disease. READ MORE A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE WORST KIND: SEPSIS DR. TIM BUCHMAN Day four of the annual professional meeting began like so many others: I had one more talk to give, and then a dash to the airport for the flight home. At lunchtime, I noticed a slight headache. By the time the session began mid-afternoon, the headache was worse. I bummed a couple of over-the-counter pain pills from a colleague (thank heavens for better prepared friends!), chugged a bottle of water, and listened to the three talks that preceded mine. READ MORE From providing care to becoming a patient: A Level One Trauma center nurse’s experience with COVID-19 and Sepsis Trina Bala, Nurse Practitioner, UF Health System As a nurse practitioner in a Level One Trauma center at UF Health, I know the signs of sepsis; I pay attention to the presentation with my trauma patients, but I never imagined that I could develop sepsis if I ever fell ill. Like every essential worker, I also was informed and alert about the risk of being exposed to COVID-19 from my patients and from my coworkers. I was mindful of the guidelines to wear my mask and avoid group settings. I was compliant. Overall, I felt I would eventually be exposed and get sick, but I was mostly unconcerned about what that meant. READ MORE Previous Next × Initially, I thought I had a cold that wouldn’t be anything serious. However, I felt an obligation to be checked for COVID before seeing patients. After my nose was swabbed I said to myself, “Now I know what patients experience when I order a COVID test, and it is not fun!” To my surprise my test was positive. My wife was also positive. After a week of self-quarantine, I was admitted to the ICU; I was weak, slow to respond and severely dehydrated. Like some of my patients, I had COVID and the infection led to sepsis. I received IV fluids, antibiotics and all of the medications that the available evidence at the time justified. I really missed my wife. I felt isolated and cut off from everyone outside of the medical personnel. She could not visit. We talked on the phone a lot, and I was relieved to learn that her symptoms were minimal. Unfortunately, things got worse for me. My oxygenation dropped to levels that were incompatible with life. I was given high-flow oxygen at the highest settings possible. I experienced delirium and required sedation. I had shaking chills, abdominal pain and difficulty breathing. I felt terrified, miserable, and lonely. I was fortunate to have nurses who did all they could to ease my suffering. The respiratory therapists were vigilant. My doctors worked diligently and put a lot of thought into every medication, test and supportive measure. I felt that I was getting the best care possible. At the same time, I knew that in spite of everyone’s best efforts, death was a strong possibility. My medical team discussed possible intubation. With my chest X-ray showing severe lung damage from the virus with pneumonia and my age of 73, I knew that after intubation I could be entering a pathway to death and that even if I survived, rehabilitation would be long with an uncertain outcome at best. I decided that if intubation was recommended, the procedure would be the only chance I had left and that I would go for it. Fortunately, I did not need to be intubated. Over the next few days, my oxygen requirement steadily decreased and my other symptoms subsided. However, there was another surprise. When I tried to get up, even with the nurses standing near to help, I couldn’t stand. I had always been able to help others. Now I felt helpless. This helplessness shocked and frustrated me. Over the next few days of a total 11-day ICU course, I progressed quickly to the point where the physical therapists advised my physician that I could be discharged to home. I was on cloud 9000 when I called my wife, and she told me she would meet me in the parking lot. The nurses then put me into a wheelchair to take me to her. My joy shattered as I was wheeled through our unit reserved for COVID patients, and I heard the sobbing of visitors whose loved ones were dying. I resolved that after discharge I would focus my energies on doing all I could to alleviate the suffering caused by this cruel disease. My recovery has not been problem free; although I still am working through the challenges, I am thankful to and will never forget all of the health professionals who care for me in spite of the risk to themselves and who recognized the signs of sepsis early enough to save my life. I am now even more acutely aware of the nexus between COVID and sepsis. Every health professional needs to be. -Dr. Simpkins is the president and chief innovation officer for the Vivacelle Bio, Inc. Northeast Indiana Innovation Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana. To kick off Sepsis Awareness Month this September and expand your knowledge, register today for a one-hour webinar at 2 p.m., EDT, September 3. Amesh Adalja, MD, FIDSA, senior scholar from Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, will discuss the role of emerging infectious diseases, including COVID-19, which can lead to sepsis. Dr. Adalja will cover the historical relationship between sepsis, coronaviruses and other pathogens; assessing the need to escalate care; identifying at-risk patients; host-based diagnostics; and improved patient management strategies. This webinar is hosted by the Sepsis Alliance and sponsored in part by the Solving Sepsis Program in BARDA's Division of Research, Innovation and Ventures (DRIVe). × × Then it happened. I was at work and suddenly I wasn’t feeling well. I had horrible chills and wanted nothing more than to go home and get into bed. I left halfway through my shift, which is something that I thought I would never do. I coincidentally had COVID-19 testing scheduled the next day as part of my company’s “back to work” plan, so I went and got tested. By the next day, I had started to feel worse. I had a headache, body aches, and some mild shortness of breath. I had abdominal pain and diarrhea. Still, I was sure the test would come back negative. It didn’t. At 7:00 at night, I got a message that said my test was positive. I just stared at it. I had so many questions. What about my family? Whom had I exposed? What do we do next? What is going to happen to me? Luckily, I had quarantined myself away from my family starting the minute I got sick. No one else had symptoms. I was in my room and office, using my own bathroom; they were bringing me food on disposable plates with disposable silverware. I even set up my own garbage can to keep my stuff separate. I felt terrible, both physically and emotionally. My shortness of breath got worse. As a healthcare worker, I was fortunate to be stocked up with thermometers, pulse ox probes, a blood pressure cuff, etc. I watched my oxygen levels drop lower and lower. I had a fever every day despite taking Tylenol around the clock. I was winded walking to and from the bathroom in my own room. I was scared, but I tried to put up a brave front; I didn’t want my kids to be scared. I just kept wondering how much worse it would get before it got better. During this time, I did not consider sepsis in myself. I knew I was sick but sepsis was furthest from my mind. However, we all need to consider the signs of sepsis that may present with mental confusion, fever, shortness of breath, feeling of dread, amongst others. Perhaps I should also not just have been asking how bad will my Covid-19 experience become, but whether this infection would lead to sepsis. As a healthcare provider, I should have known to ask myself whether signs of sepsis were presenting. After about five days, the nausea and vomiting started. I had been trying hard to take in enough fluids, but then I couldn’t take in anything. Even a sip of water would make me sick. I knew I needed to go to the hospital, but I couldn’t bear the thought of going. I couldn’t even imagine how I would get to the car and walk into the ER. And wait. The trip seemed too exhausting to even consider. My primary care doctor was in close contact with me that entire first week, and she did what she could to get me through, but there are no approved outpatient treatment options. I finally agreed to go to the ER. With the vomiting, pounding head, and dropping oxygen levels , I was relieved to be getting help. The staff started me on oxygen. I had a chest CT scan that did not look great. I got steroids and antibiotics. The staff convinced me to stay. I was admitted for a week. I had elevated inflammatory markers, including elevated cardiac and liver enzymes. With these clinical presentations and evidence of organ dysfunction - was I septic? I never thought about it, but reflecting back, I presented with the signs of sepsis. I needed fluid, I had pulmonary, cardiac, and liver dysfunction, and I required hospitalization which means I met the definition of sepsis. The steroids did wonders. My appetite returned. I was able to wean down the oxygen from 3L to room air. My exercise tolerance improved to the point where I could shower without too much trouble. After the week, I felt stable enough to go home. I paid privately for home oxygen in case I needed it. At home I still had shortness of breath requiring occasional oxygen, bad chest pain and body aches, diarrhea and the headaches that I just couldn’t get under control. I continued to get tested every three days until I finally had a negative test- a month after my first symptoms. I could finally hug my kids and leave my room. I had to push past an irrational fear that even though the test was negative I still might be contagious. I returned to work, probably way too soon. I worked five hours and then had to leave. I was so tired. Now, another month later, I can finish a whole shift, but it’s not easy. Walking from the parking lot is hard. I’m not even attempting a flight of stairs. The headaches finally subsided. I would never have predicted that I would be someone who could develop sepsis from COVID-19. I have no idea what the end of this illness looks like because I haven’t gotten there yet. I am thankful that my experience was not as bad as many others; I survived. Sepsis awareness month is a great time for healthcare providers and people everywhere to remind ourselves that with every infection we need to ask “could this be sepsis?” and be thankful for the healthcare providers who take care of us. × × Explore the Sepsis Portfolio The Solving Sepsis program is addressing the entire continuum of care of a sepsis patient – from early pre-hospital interactions with healthcare providers, through hospital care and discharge – seeking innovative interventions at each step to identify sepsis early, address clinical management in order to improve patient outcomes and decrease mortality.

Nursing home patients, an at-risk population, will be continuously monitored for early indication of changes in health status or potentially inform on COVID-19 infection. In addition, in a separate cohort, COVID-19 patients will be monitored to determine any changes in health, including QT interval changes which may require an escalation in care. The elderly and individuals with underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Early indication of patient deterioration or cardiac arrhythmia will allow healthcare professionals to intervene earlier in order to improve clinical management of patients and health outcomes. These pilot clinical studies will be conducted as part of quality improvement to support use of these remote monitoring technologies as adjunctive diagnostic health support. The Vista Solution incorporates four primary components; The VitalPatch clinical grade biosensor, a Vista Tablet, the VitalCloud, and the VistaCenter central monitoring station. Through the Vista Solution, clinicians can monitor up to 11 different patient vitals in real-time including those captured by the VitalPatch (single-lead EKG, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, body temperature, body posture, fall detection, activity) and those captured by 3rd party devices (blood oxygen, weight, blood pressure). COVID-19 patients suffer from a variety of symptoms including respiratory distress, low blood oxygen levels, and cardiac arrhythmia, which can all be monitored with the Vista Solution.

The single, randomized, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the two investigational drugs, MSTT1041A (anti-ST2) and UTTR1147A (IL-22-Fc) in approximately 300 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen. Both may prevent COVID-19 pneumonia progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and/or promote convalescence of patients with ARDS. ST2 is the receptor for IL-33, and inhibition of IL-33 signaling via inhibition of ST2 is predicted to reduce maladaptive hyperinflammatory responses. IL22 is a cytokine that promotes epithelial and endothelial cell repair and may prevent secondary bacterial infections. Currently there are no approved treatments for ARDS caused by COVID-19 pneumonia.

Exebacase is the first product candidate in a new family of protein-based antimicrobials known as direct lytic agents (DLAs). DLAs present a potential new medical modality for the treatment of life-threatening, antibiotic-resistant infections. DLAs, like exebacase, catalyze the destruction of the bacterial cell wall, resulting in rapid, targeted bacteriolysis. This unique activity makes it difficult for bacteria to develop resistance to exebacase. Exebacase also has the potential to eradicate biofilms, which can complicate medical treatment. Exebacase has been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). S. aureus remains a major health challenge and is associated with mortality rates of 20-40 percent. MRSA, in particular, continues to be the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and bacterial sepsis in the U.S. and ranks as a serious threat on the 2019 CDC Antibiotic Resistance Threat list. This pathogen is often an opportunistic, secondary infection that occurs as a consequence of a breakdown in infection control practices such as those observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. If successful, exebacase could significantly improve clinical outcomes when used in addition to standard of care antibiotics against S. aureus bacteremia (SAB), including MRSA. This partnership will support Phase 3 clinical development and the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA, as well as post-approval activities including a pediatric study and a lyophilized drug product formulation to facilitate long-term storage. About ContraFect Corporation: The following information is provided by company and does not indicate endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products. ContraFect is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of direct lytic agents (DLAs), including lysins and amurin peptides, as new medical modalities for the treatment of life-threatening, antibiotic-resistant infections. The company intends to address life threatening infections using our therapeutic product candidates from its platform of DLAs, which include lysins and amurin peptides. Lysins are a new class of DLAs which are recombinantly produced antimicrobial proteins with a novel mechanism of action associated with the rapid killing of target bacteria, eradication of biofilms and synergy with conventional antibiotics. Amurin peptides are a novel class of DLAs which exhibit broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter species.

The Janssen vaccine is a recombinant vector vaccine that uses a human adenovirus to express the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Adenoviruses are a group of viruses that cause infections in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts; the adenovirus vector used in the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine has been modified so it no longer can replicate in humans and cause illness. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, supported late-stage clinical testing of the Janssen vaccine. It is the third COVID-19 vaccine in the United States to be granted an EUA by FDA. NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D. Ph.D., NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., and BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D., released the following statements: “This week marked a devastating milestone of 500,000 deaths from COVID-19 here in the United States. The loss attributed to the disease is almost unfathomable. To have a third vaccine that meets the expectations of an EUA for safety and effectiveness at preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19 brings us one step closer to protecting the American public, staying ahead of concerning viral variants, and finding our way out of the pandemic. I would like to thank the clinical staff who conducted the clinical trials of the vaccine as well as the thousands of study participants who helped us find the scientific answers necessary to reach this important day.” – NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is a very welcome addition to the arsenal of COVID-19 vaccines and other prevention strategies. When tested among 45,000 volunteers, the single-injection vaccine proved 77 percent effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after vaccination and 85 percent effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 28 days after vaccination. The vaccine was approximately 67 percent effective in preventing moderate-to-severe/critical COVID-19 disease occurring at least 14 days after vaccination and 66 percent effective in preventing moderate-to-severe/critical COVID-19 disease occurring at least 28 days after vaccination. Importantly, the vaccine was 100 percent effective in protecting against death from the disease everywhere it was tested. In addition to meeting the expectations of safety and effectiveness to support emergency use authorization, the Janssen vaccine has the advantage of requiring only a single injection and can be easily transported and stored without special refrigeration requirements. To get control of the COVID-19 pandemic, stay ahead of worrisome viral mutations, and protect the American public, we must vaccinate as many Americans as we can as quickly as possible. The Janssen vaccine provides yet another option to help achieve those goals.” – NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “The FDA’s emergency use authorization of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is exciting news on many fronts. A single dose vaccine stored at refrigerated temperatures and that prevents hospitalizations and deaths from COVID has the potential to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and globally. Janssen and BARDA have a history of working together, developing treatments and vaccines for influenza and Ebola. To manufacture their COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, Janssen is working with resources we established after the 2009 influenza pandemic: our Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing and our fill-finish manufacturing network. With the development of this vaccine, we are seeing the results of years of work on platform technologies and public-private partnerships coming to fruition.” – BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. Francis S.

Molnupiravir (MK-4482) is designed to induce viral genome copying errors to prevent the virus from replicating in the human body, and evidence to date from clinical trials in patients with COVID-19 suggests that molnupiravir may reduce replication of the SAR-CoV-2 virus. This treatment is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 trial for its potential to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death in non-hospitalized patients who have symptoms for five days or less and are at high risk for severe illness. The trial plans to enroll a total of 1,850 patients globally with final data expected in the fall of 2021. In studies, molnupiravir has demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against other viruses such as influenza, Ebola, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus, although molnupiravir has not been approved by the FDA for treatment of these diseases. This agreement is part of the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government approach to develop new COVID-19 treatments and to respond to the health needs of the public through unprecedented partnership between agencies including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense. This approach leverages all expertise and resources available to respond to COVID-19 such as funding the development and manufacturing of therapeutics, including antivirals. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) and Army Contracting Command, on the $1.2 billion purchase agreement for the 1.7 million 5-day treatment courses of molnupiravir to be procured only if FDA grants emergency use authorization (EUA) or approval. Molnupiravir is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Merck is scaling up manufacturing while clinical trials are underway to deliver molnupiravir as quickly as possible, pending FDA EUA or approval. If FDA grants EUA or approval, the federal government will allocate molnupiravir to states and U.S. territories, and healthcare providers will be able to order the product directly from the distributor within those allocations.

Part of the strategy was BARDA’s establishment of a Clinical Studies Network (CSN) that can provide comprehensive (Phase 1-4) clinical study services to help evaluate the safety, dosage, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and efficacy of MCM candidates. In 2014, BARDA created its CSN by partnering with five (5) Contract Research Organizations including TRI, ClinicalRM, Emmes, Rho and PPD. The CSN became immediately engaged in the Ebola Response in 2015 as part of BARDA’s National MCM Response Infrastructure. The CSN worked with CDC, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health, and the Sierra Leone College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences to conduct the Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE). The STRIVE study began enrolling healthcare workers and other front line workers in April, 2015, and over 8,000 subjects received an investigational vaccine to prevent Ebola. The study will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. BARDA’s CSN is providing staff training, clinical site development and monitoring, and data management, biostatistics, safety, cold chain, and logistics support. In March, 2016, the CSN launched BARDA’s first sponsored trial, the BARDA Ready in Times of Emergency (BRITE) study, evaluating safety and immune responses of H5N1 pre-pandemic influenza vaccines and adjuvants that have been stored in the national stockpile for up to 10 years. The study is being conducted at 6 US sites selected in part because of their proximity to poultry farms or research laboratories in order to target workers at higher risk of exposure to avian influenza. The results of this study are expected to inform future decisions on the length of time pre-pandemic influenza vaccines and adjuvants maintain their activity and are safe to store in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile in order to help protect the US population. The CSN also worked with BARDA’s Chemical MCM Program to compile data for a supplemental FDA New Drug Application for midazolam (an anticonvulsant drug) administered by auto-injector to treat neurotoxin-induced seizures. BARDA-supported FDA approval of intramuscular midazolam for emergency treatment of prolonged seizures in children and adults will ensure that this vital MCM is widely available to first-responders. The CSN plans in 2016-2018 to conduct additional clinical studies linked to BARDA’s areas of investment, including heterologous prime boost studies of different influenza vaccines in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile, studies of an anthrax vaccine for an elderly population, and studies of candidate therapies against MERS-CoV infection in the Middle East. In conjunction with partner programs in the National MCM Response Infrastructure, these activities will increase BARDA’s readiness to respond to biothreats and public health emergencies.

These threats include natural and man-made biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats. As a member of the PHEMCE, DHS is the lead agency responsible for conducting the threat and risk assessments that are leveraged in PHEMCE requirements setting. DHS is also a key partner in PHEMCE response planning, policy, guidance, and communication. Within DHS, the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) strives to equip decision-makers with tools for better assessing the significant risks that chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats pose to the nation. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-276), requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, to make determinations of CBRN agents that are material threats to the U.S. population and authorizes the Secretary of HHS to determine the public health consequences and recommend countermeasures to such threats. If suitable countermeasures do not already exist, this process can culminate in a joint DHS-HHS recommendation to the President or his delegate, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to authorize the use of BioShield special reserve funds. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) 10, 22, and 18, DHS is mandated to conduct the Biological Terrorism Risk Assessment, the Chemical Terrorism Risk Assessment, the Radiological and Nuclear Terrorism Risk Assessment, and the Integrated CBRN Terrorism Risk Assessment. The first step in the BioShield process is threat identification and prioritization in order to inform medical countermeasure development and acquisition. DHS has the lead in threat identification and leverages the DHS Integrated Terrorism Risk Assessment findings to determine which CBRN agents present a greater risk based on the relative risk ranking against the U.S. population sufficient to affect national security. Specifically, for the highest ranked agents in the TRA, DHS evaluates the intelligence and threat information and develops and models a highly plausible consequence scenario taking into account acquisition, production, dissemination efficacy, source strength and meteorological conditions. This model is used to derive an estimate of the number of potentially exposed individuals at various levels of exposure, which becomes part of the MTA. The estimates are provided to HHS, which conducts its Public Health Consequence Modeling (PHCM) as the basis for determining public health impacts. For agents considered to be a material threat, HHS determines whether these agents lack an existing, effective countermeasure and whether a countermeasure should be procured using BioShield reserve funds. If so, then HHS coordinates activities within the interagency Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) to define countermeasure requirements and acquisition options.

This system will utilize a wearable physiological monitor, Empatica’s E4 wristband device, to detect early signs of infection in individuals. Study participants also will self-collect daily nasal swabs, self-report symptoms, and self-collect daily saturated oxygen read-outs for analysis by Empatica. All data will be used to fine-tune and validate Empatica’s early diagnostic algorithm, which will provide a probability of infection. The results will be shared with the user via a mobile application and a caregiver through a web dashboard. The overall goal of the platform is to provide an early warning to COVID-19 contagion, helping reduce the transmission of infected individuals and save lives. Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may only seek diagnostic tests once they begin exhibiting symptoms. Empatica aims to disrupt this health-care paradigm by detecting infection in individuals before the onset of symptoms. This project will leverage data from a previous partnership with BARDA on early detection of respiratory infection, and include a clinical study monitoring at-risk healthcare workers for COVID-19. The goal is to alert healthcare workers and patients to infection early, preventing further spread by allowing for early self-quarantine, treatment, and care.

Significant progress has been made in improving capabilities to address the immediate public health… National Biodefense Strategy 2018 It is a vital interest of the United States to manage the risk of biological incidents. In today’s interconnected world, biological incidents have the potential to cost thousands of American lives, cause significant anxiety, and greatly impact travel and trade. Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and Implementation Plan 2017-2018 The U.S. continues to face a range of serious threats to its health security from the unintentional release or deliberate use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents, as well as naturally occurring emerging infectious diseases (EID), including pandemic influenza. Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and Implementation Plan 2016 Considering the progress achieved and the remaining strategic gaps in MCM preparedness, the PHEMCE annually examines the SIP goals and objectives and re-adjusts or adds to them, as needed. Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Stakeholders Workshop Report 2016 The goal of the 2016 PHEMCE Stakeholders Workshop was to provide a forum within which a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the PHEMCE mission of effective provision of emergency medical countermeasures could learn about PHEMCE activities, interact, and provide input to PHEMCE partners about their interests, issues, concerns, and priorities. Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and Implementation Plan 2015 The United States (U.S.) continues to face a range of serious threats to its national health security from the deliberate use or accidental release of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents, as well as from naturally occurring and emerging infectious diseases (EID), including pandemic influenza. Since the development of the 2014 PHEMCE SIP, the PHEMCE has made significant progress in achieving the priorities described in the 2014 PHEMCE SIP. Project BioShield Report 2014 Significant progress was made in 2014 in the regulatory review and approval of MCMs procured under Project BioShield. PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation Plan 2014 The United States continues to face a range of serious threats to its national health security from the deliberate use or accidental release of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents, as well as from naturally occurring and emerging infectious diseases (EID), including pandemic influenza. Project BioShield Annual Report 2013 The Project BioShield Act of 2004 [Project BioShield (PBS); Public Law [P.L.] 108-276] amended the Public Health Service (PHS) Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act to provide additional & more flexible authorities and funding to support financially the development and procurement of medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and; nuclear (CBRN) threat agents. It was also designed to provide the government authority to quickly authorize use during emergencies. Project BioShield Annual Report to Congress 2012 The Medical Countermeasures (MCM) Enterprise had a significant year in 2012. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) continued to leverage recommendations of the ""Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review: Transforming the Enterprise to Meet Long-Range National Needs"" (MCM Review), released in August 2010, to foster and promote capabilities to prepare and respond to a wide range of threats while balancing limited resources. PHEMCE Implementation Plan 2012 The 2012 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Implementation Plan describes the priorities that HHS, in collaboration with its interagency partners, will implement over the next five years to advance the strategic goals and underlying objectives established in the 2012 PHEMCE Strategy.Priorities are identified along the near- (Fiscal Year [FY] 12-14), mid- (FY15-17), and long-term (FY18 and beyond) timeframes where appropriate. PHEMCE Strategy 2012 The U.S. Government has a responsibility to protect the health and safety of its citizens. The American people continue to face a host of national health security threats from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents (e.g., weapons that could be used to kill or injure a large number of people) and emerging infectious diseases (EID) (e.g., 1918-19 influenza pandemic outbreak). BARDA Strategic Plan The nation has endeavored over the past ten years to become better prepared for the medical consequences of catastrophic events such as bioterrorist events and pandemic influenza. During that time period Project BioShield, The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority have emerged to support the development and acquisition of medical countermeasures (MCMs) and the domestic manufacturing capacity to prepare for and respond to an emergency. Project BioShield Annual Report to Congress 2011 The medical countermeasures pipeline has never held more promise than it does today. Innovation, enhanced partnerships and collaboration, and sustained investments throughout the last decade have resulted in the addition of eight new countermeasures in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS ), able to treat the effects of anthrax, botulism, smallpox, and radiological and nuclear agents. Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review Emerging infectious diseases, pandemics, and bioterrorism carry the potential for catastrophic impact, and the U.S. government has faced chronic challenges in producing medical countermeasures against such threats, as exemplified during the recent 2009-H1N1 pandemic. The President called out the renewed need for a national capability to respond to these threats in the State of the Union, and the Secretary of HHS stepped forward to address this need.

The test detects the presence of COVID-19 in nasal and throat swabs and can be performed in community hospitals and other facilities with access to medium-complexity laboratories, thereby greatly increasing the number of tests that can be run. BARDA will contribute approximately $642,000 of the total $1.7 million estimated project cost, and Luminex will fund the remaining development costs. Luminex has designed an assay that runs on its FDA-cleared ARIES® molecular diagnostic system for presence of COVID-19 by detecting the virus in respiratory swabs. The ARIES System is Luminex’s sample-to-answer, six-color, real-time PCR instrument. ARIES assays require little training, take less than five minutes of hands-on time, and produce results in about two hours. The Luminex solution consists of the ARIES® System and up to six cassettes. Each assay cassette contains all the reagents needed for nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection for one sample. An operator adds the sample, in this case, a respiratory swab, to the cassette’s sample chamber, scans the sample ID and cassette, puts up to six cassettes in a magazine, and loads the magazine into the ARIES® System. The system starts automatically and reports results without further operator intervention. The Luminex ARIES® SARS-CoV-2 assay detects via PCR, two SARS-CoV-2 targets within the “N” gene, for improved accuracy. This is the second Luminex diagnostic to be supported by BARDA. The first was Luminex’s NxTAG® CoV Extended Panel which received FDA Emergency Use Authorization on March 27, 2020.This award is one component of BARDA’s rapidly expanding COVID-19 medical countermeasure portfolio; visit BARDA’s COVID-19 Portfolio to learn more.

A primary goal of the program is to establish national stockpiles of FDA-approved antivirals to ensure treatment of influenza-infected persons during an influenza pandemic. Maintenance of this antiviral stockpile allows potentially life-saving treatment of millions of people, including pediatric populations, during an influenza pandemic. An equally important goal of the program is to support advanced development of new antiviral and immunotherapeutic candidates towards FDA approval to address the critical need for new classes of antivirals and immunotherapeutics, and for treatment options that can be used later in the course of infection to treat severely ill, influenza infected patients who are hospitalized. In 2009, BARDA, in cooperation with CDC, met the National Strategy goal of stockpiling 81 million treatment courses of influenza antivirals in state and federal stockpiles, including 17 million treatment courses for pediatric populations. BARDA provided subsidies to States and contracting mechanisms to procure influenza antiviral drugs for their stockpiles. Portions of these assets were deployed to the States during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; the federal stockpiles were subsequently replenished and maintained at the requirement level. CDC maintain influenza therapeutic stockpiles, and BARDA continues to lead advanced development of novel therapeutics to address unmet needs, especially those of severely ill, hospitalized, and pediatric populations. The Influenza Therapeutics Program has funded six novel antiviral advanced development projects since 2007. One of the earliest projects supported development of intravenous (IV) peramivir, which received Emergency Use Authorization during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. This product (Rapivab®) recently received FDA approval in 2014 as a single-dose influenza antiviral drug for treatment of uncomplicated influenza. In 2015, BARDA awarded contracts to support two new novel influenza therapeutics that have novel mechanisms of action compared to existing approved antivirals. Rapid emergence of novel influenza strains with resistance to available antiviral agents, lack of approved treatment options for hospitalized and other “at risk” populations, and the lack of universally-validated clinical endpoints for severe cases of influenza leads the Influenza Therapeutics Program to seek immunotherapeutic candidates for treatment of influenza. The program continues to support advanced development of novel antiviral agent candidates but also includes monoclonal antibodies that neutralize influenza virus by binding to the hemagglutinin stalk region. The Program also supports candidates that prevent transcription or replication of viral genomes by inhibiting viral polymerase or other viral activities and that modulate the immune response by affecting host factors. Novel antiviral drugs, especially when used in conjunction with early identification through diagnostics, can strengthen preparedness and response levels by enabling public health professionals to effectively treat influenza disease in patients, and thereby potentially limit the spread of disease in communities.

We will rally the great promise of American science and innovation to confront the greatest danger of our time.""President George W. Bush at the signing of the Project BioShield Act of 2004 Critical Mission for Biodefense On July 21, 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (Project BioShield) into law as part of a broader strategy to defend America against the threat of weapons of mass destruction. The purpose of Project BioShield is to accelerate the research, development, purchase, and availability of effective medical countermeasures against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents. HHS provides Congress with an annual report on its progress in the implementation of Project BioShield. Project BioShield: Three Approaches to Biodefense Funding of Needed Countermeasures: Project BioShield institutes a secure funding source for the purchase of critical medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Project BioShield authorizes $5.6 billion in funding over 10 years for the advanced development and purchase of priority medical countermeasures. This ""Special Reserve Fund"" was provided in the FY2004 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act and becomes available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for procurements following interagency and White House approval. Within HHS, the Office of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has the procurement authority for Project BioShield acquisitions utilizing the Special Reserve Fund. Facilitating Research and Development: Project BioShield grants the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases authorities to expedite and simplify the solicitation, review, and award of grants and contracts for the development of critical medical countermeasures. Facilitating the Use of Medical Countermeasures in an Emergency: Project BioShield establishes the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA ) to provide access to the best available medical countermeasures following a Declaration of Emergency by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Declaration could be based on either the Secretary's determination of a public health emergency with the significant potential to affect national security, or on a heightened risk of a CBRN attack on the public or U.S. military forces (as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Secretary of Defense, respectively). Project BioShield: Critical Part of the U.S. Biodefense Strategy Congress seeks to improve our Nation's emergency preparedness with Project BioShield, which provides the government with the ability to develop, acquire, stockpile, and make available the medical countermeasures needed to protect the U.S. population against weapons of mass destruction. The development and availability of medical countermeasures are key components of the President's biodefense strategy, as outlined in Biodefense for the 21st Century. The three aspects of Project BioShield aim to seamlessly integrate medical countermeasure acquisitions with overall U.S. Government preparedness and emergency response plans. Under Project BioShield, the U.S. Government seeks to make balanced acquisitions of the most urgently needed medical countermeasures, within the constraints of the budget. In support of this goal, the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Governance Board, which is chaired by the ASPR, is responsible for coordinating the research, development, regulation, procurement, stockpiling, and deployment of medical countermeasures needed to protect the public in the event of a public health emergency. Mission areas include: Defining and prioritizing requirements for public health emergency medical countermeasures Focusing research, development, and procurement activities on the identified requirements, and Establishing deployment and use strategies for medical countermeasures in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). HHS works in close collaboration with key partners, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. HHS, through BARDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, executes acquisition programs, utilizing the Special Reserve Fund commensurate with these priorities. HHS also works to promote open communication of U.S. Government needs to industry, an essential partner in Project BioShield. The availability of a substantial, long-term funding source was designed to provide the incentive for industry to respond to U.S. Government requirements and develop critical medical countermeasures for the American public.

Mapp and its collaborators will isolate, screen, and characterize BoNT monoclonal antibodies, ultimately combining them into a “pan-BoNT"" therapeutic treatment made up of four or fewer mAbs. The treatment would address all seven major types of Botulinum. The top antibody candidates will be expressed in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell expression system which eliminates the need to collect antibodies from human and other animal sources. Currently, two effective medical countermeasures are available to treat Botulinum neurotoxins; however, both of the MCMs rely on a dwindling supply of polyclonal immunoglobulin from human or equine sources, and only one, HBAT, addresses all seven serotypes of Botulinum.

Chrysalis will conduct safety studies and additional activities required to request emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and approval under the FDA Animal Rule TP508 is a potential first-in-class countermeasure to prevent injury and death from ionizing radiation exposure. The therapeutic candidate may mitigate vascular damage, inhibit hemorrhage, reduce inflammation, and reverse acute tissue damage induced by radiation. TP508 is a peptide (one or more amino acids that make up proteins in the human body) derived from the larger thrombin protein that is normally released at the point of injury to stimulate vascular and stem cell repair and to regenerate damaged tissue. Radiation exposure can have acute and delayed effects including damage to blood vessel that make up the body’s circulatory system, leading to inflammation, coagulopathies (excessive bleeding or clotting), sepsis, and multi-organ failure. This novel peptide drug restores vascular function by activating stem cells and stimulating endothelial cells (the thin layer of cells that line the inside of the heart and blood vessels). By enhancing nitric oxide signaling, the drug may also help reduce inflammation, accelerate DNA repair, and prevent coagulopathies. Together, these effects of TP508 could reduce injury, illness, death, and delayed consequences from acute radiation exposure. About Chrysalis BioTherapeutics, Inc.: The following information is provided by the company and does not indicate endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products. Chrysalis BioTherapeutics, Inc. was established in 2012 to develop and commercialize safe and effective drugs to save lives and improve quality of life. Chrysalis is pioneering the use of natural regenerative peptides to restore vascular function and activate normal stem cell populations where they exist in the body to accelerate tissue repair and prevent damaging effects of trauma, disease, ischemia, and radiation exposure.

Expansion activities are expected to begin mid-year to deliver material and could be available as soon as the end of 2020. Moderna has previously announced its new collaboration with Lonza in the United States and this funding supports that manufacturing capacity expansion. BARDA awarded a contract to ModernaTX on April 16 to accelerate vaccine development through licensure and manufacturing scale-up of mRNA-1273 development initiated with support from support from the National Institutes of Health and CEPI. This vaccine is the first COVID-19 product to transition from NIH to BARDA for advanced development. The process used to manufacture mRNA-1273 is rapid and scalable. By expanding to additional domestic manufacturing suites (scale-out), the U.S. government can make available more COVID-19 vaccines earlier and faster. A safe, effective, and deployable vaccine is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigating future waves, and saving lives. The urgency to develop and deploy at least one safe and effective vaccine is critical to saving lives, protecting Americans and reducing the economic impact from this pandemic. Time is of the essence. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that COVID-19 is causing the U.S. to lose approximately $4.48 billion per day in Gross Domestic Product until the U.S. economy can return to the same pre-COVID state of health. A successful vaccine can speed this economic rebound. Aligned with Operation Warp Speed, BARDA continues to take aggressive action and plan ahead for successful vaccines in order to save lives, protect Americans and aid economic recovery. BARDA is investing to accelerate manufacturing scale-up and deployment of vaccines, in parallel with ongoing clinical development. While large investments in manufacturing and vaccine supplies before FDA approval presents a financial risk, continuing to make these investments is critical to shave months to years off the vaccine development timeline and meet the Administration’s directive to make vaccine available more rapidly. BARDA will continue to make risk-adjusted investments across the COVID-19 medical countermeasures portfolio, in an effort to accelerate medical countermeasures with the goal of saving lives, protecting Americans, and reducing the long term economic impact of this pandemic. The U.S. National Institute of Health is conducting the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 under an NIH-Investigator New Drug Application (IND). Moderna, with support from BARDA, began a Phase 2 study under Moderna’s own IND in June. Concurrently, NIH, BARDA, and Moderna are finalizing the Phase 3 clinical trial plan. The expansion of domestic manufacture will allow significant manufacturing capacity to produce and make mRNA-1273 available to the US sooner.

By funding this manufacturing effort, the federal government will own the doses expected to result from the demonstration project. The ongoing REGN-COV2 clinical studies are evaluating multiple dosages to help establish the exact number of potential treatment doses. The company estimates between 70,000 and 300,000 treatment doses could be available from this project, with the initial doses ready as early as end of summer and completed this fall. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or approves the treatment, the federal government would allocate these doses to treat COVID-19 patients. “This agreement with Regeneron is the first of a number of Operation Warp Speed awards to support potential therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing, allowing faster distribution if trials are successful,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “More good news about COVID-19 therapeutics is constantly emerging, and President Trump’s commitment to supporting lifesaving therapeutics will help deliver these products to American patients without a day’s delay.” This manufacturing demonstration project will take place while clinical trials are underway. Working in parallel this way shaves months off the traditional product development timeline and supports the Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed goal of making safe and effective medicine available as quickly as possible to save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command, to provide $450 million to Regeneron for the large-scale manufacturing demonstration project in the United States. As part of the manufacturing demonstration project, the doses of the medicine will be packaged and ready to ship immediately if clinical trials are successful and FDA grants an EUA or approves the medicine. If these government-funded doses become available under EUA or FDA approval, the medicine would be available to the American people at no cost and would be allocated similarly to drugs that other companies have donated during the pandemic response. As is customary with such government-purchased products, healthcare professionals could charge insurers for the cost of administering the medicine. An EUA can be issued to facilitate the availability of an unapproved product only after several statutory requirements are met. For investigational treatments being developed to treat or prevent COVID-19, FDA will make an assessment on a case-by-case basis depending on the product’s characteristics, preclinical and human clinical study data, and the totality of relevant available scientific evidence. The issuance of an EUA is different than FDA approval. The REGN-COV2 investigational antibody therapeutic treatment was discovered and developed by Regeneron using the company’s VelociSuite technologies. The medicine combines two monoclonal antibodies, informally known as an antibody cocktail, that bind to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and may be able to treat infected patients or prevent infection. Monoclonal antibodies are produced outside of the body by a single clone of cells or a cell line with identical antibody molecules and then delivered to patients by injection or infusion. The antibodies bind to certain proteins of a virus, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. Preclinical and clinical development for this therapeutic treatment have been supported in part through a long-standing flexible agreement between BARDA and Regeneron. Regeneron used the same proprietary technology platforms and cocktail approach to develop a novel triple antibody treatment for Ebola that is now under regulatory review by the FDA.

Under the terms of the agreement, the federal government will own the resulting 100 million doses of vaccine. The vaccine doses could be used in clinical trials or, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes use as outlined in agency guidance, the doses would be distributed as part of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. “With the portfolio of vaccines being assembled for Operation Warp Speed, the Trump Administration is increasing the likelihood that the United States will have at least one safe, effective vaccine by 2021,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Today’s investment represents the next step in supporting Janssen’s vaccine candidate all the way through manufacturing, with the potential to bring hundreds of millions of safe and effective doses to the American people.” This manufacturing demonstration project will take place while clinical trials are underway. Working in parallel this way expedites the traditional vaccine development timeline. This step builds toward the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed goal to begin delivering millions of doses of safe and effective vaccines to the American people by the end of the year. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command, to provide approximately $1 billion to support the manufacturing demonstration project including the ability to deliver vaccine doses to government-designated locations across the country. The government also can acquire additional doses up to a quantity sufficient to vaccinate 300 million people. The project announced today includes fill-finish manufacturing in U.S.-based facilities. This fill-finish manufacturing step ensures vaccine doses are packaged and ready to ship immediately, subject to successful clinical trials and FDA authorization. If these doses are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the vaccine would be available to the American people at no cost. As is customary with government-purchased vaccines, healthcare professionals could charge for the cost of administering the vaccine. To date, BARDA has provided approximately $456 million for clinical trials and other vaccine development activities under an existing, long-term partnership with Janssen. The company’s investigational vaccine relies on Janssen’s recombinant adenovirus technology, AdVac, a technology used to develop and manufacture Janssen’s Ebola vaccine with BARDA support; that vaccine received European Commission approval and was used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda during the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak that began in the DRC.

The federal government will own these vaccine doses. Moderna will manufacture the vaccine doses while clinical trials are underway. Manufacturing in parallel with clinical trials expedites the traditional vaccine development timeline and builds toward the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed goal to begin delivering safe and effective vaccines to the American people by the end of the year. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes use as outlined in agency guidance, the vaccine doses would be distributed and used as part of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. “In creating a vaccine portfolio for Operation Warp Speed, the Trump Administration is increasing the likelihood that the United States will have at least one safe, effective vaccine by 2021,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Today’s investment represents the next step in supporting this vaccine candidate all the way from early development by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, through clinical trials, and now large-scale manufacturing, with the potential to bring hundreds of millions of safe and effective doses to the American people.” The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command to provide up to approximately $1.5 billion to manufacture and deliver the vaccine doses to government-designated locations across the country. The government also can acquire up to an additional 400 million doses of the vaccine. The project announced today includes fill-finish manufacturing in U.S.-based facilities. This fill-finish manufacturing step ensures vaccine doses are packaged and ready to ship immediately, subject to successful clinical trials and FDA authorization. If these doses are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the vaccine would be available to the American people at no cost. As is customary with government-purchased vaccines, healthcare professionals could charge for the cost of administering the vaccine. The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, has been co-developed by Moderna and scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. NIAID has continued to support the vaccine’s development including nonclinical studies and clinical trials. In addition, BARDA has supported phase 2/3 clinical trials, vaccine manufacturing scale up and other development activities for this vaccine. The Phase 3 clinical trial, which began July 27, is the first government-funded Phase 3 clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. About Operation Warp Speed: OWS is a partnership among components of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, engaging with private firms and other federal agencies, and coordinating among existing HHS-wide efforts to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/newsroom/2020/marinus/","BARDA and Marinus Partner to Develop New Treatment for Refractory Seizures","BARDA and Marinus Pharmaceuticals have begun a collaboration to develop ganaxolone (GNX) to treat seizures that are not stopped by first-line anticonvulsants like benzodiazepines.","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA BARDA and Marinus Partner to Develop New Treatment for Refractory Seizures WEB ANNOUNCEMENT Share BARDA and Marinus Pharmaceuticals have begun a collaboration to develop ganaxolone (GNX) to treat seizures that are not stopped by first-line anticonvulsants like benzodiazepines. This treatment could potentially stop damaging seizures no matter the underlying medical etiology, including seizures that result from exposure to nerve agents like Sarin. Unremitting continuous or near-continuous seizures (also called status epilepticus or SE) are a life-threatening condition that can lead to permanent brain damage and disability. SE can arise from a range of underlying medical etiologies or from exposure to chemical weapon nerve agents. Limited FDA-approved treatments for SE are available; generally, intravenous antiepileptic drugs are used to terminate the seizures. However, 30% to 50% of cases may progress to refractory SE, i.e. are not successfully treated with available first- or second-line anticonvulsants, and may require IV anesthetics to stop seizures. Marinus recently completed a Phase II clinical study of GNX for refractory SE. None of the 17 patients in the study progressed to treatment with IV anesthesia, and 16 of the 17 remained free of SE for 24 hours following initiation of treatment. The new partnership between BARDA and Marinus will support studies, including a pivotal, large-scale Phase III clinical trial to support regulatory approval of GNX for the treatment of refractory SE, as well as non-clinical studies of nerve agent-induced refractory seizures. Marinus will also work to bring production of GNX into the United States. Organophosphate nerve agents (chemical warfare agents and organophosphate-based pesticides) are highly toxic compounds, which cause overstimulation of the body’s central and peripheral nervous system. One consequence of this is seizures that may be prolonged and become more difficult to treat as they continue. The U.S. government fields benzodiazepine anticonvulsants as nerve agent antidotes; however, if treatment is delayed as is possible in a mass-exposure situation, those drugs may be less effective at stopping the seizures. GNX stops seizures by a slightly different mechanism than benzodiazepine anticonvulsants; the two drugs may work in a complementary fashion to stop seizure. In this way, GNX may be able to treat unremitting seizures when other drugs have failed, with the potential to save lives and improve long-term health outcomes for people exposed to nerve agents. If FDA approves GNX, it could become the standard of care for treating refractory seizures. Widespread use for the treatment of refractory SE from a range of underlying medical conditions in communities across the country would ensure the drug’s broad availability in the event of a public health emergency involving mass exposure to nerve agent. By leveraging commonly available drugs to treat the effects of accidental or intentional chemical threat agent exposures, BARDA helps the nation prepare for public health emergencies as cost-efficiently as possible, and can make products available that healthcare providers are familiar with and comfortable using should the need ever arise. About Marinus The following information is provided by the company and does not indicate endorsement by the federal government of the company or its products. Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat rare seizure disorders.

To assist and inform its planning, preparedness, and real-time response requirements, BARDA established the Analytical Decision Support (ADS) group as a central modeling and analysis hub for HHS. The Modeling Hub provides analytic support to identify and understand medical and public health consequence gaps for operational aspects of medical countermeasure deployment and administration. This includes detailing the challenges and uncertainties which are key to communicating results to decision makers. The Modeling Hub provides analytical support to BARDA, ASPR, and the PHEMCE partners by developing analyses, identifying processes, and assisting in the structuring of decision support systems focusing on medical countermeasure decision making capabilities. These efforts span advanced research and development of medical countermeasures to include the planning and operations to improve the level of public health preparedness and federal response capabilities for CBRN, influenza, and emerging infectious disease scenarios. One key area of investigation is capabilities-based analysis. This analysis identifies the response capabilities (like reduction in fatalities) that are possible with different response strategies and resources based on the consequences from the exposure scenario. Different exposure scenarios can create different demands on the response strategies and resources depending on the number, severity, timeframe, and spatial extent of the exposed population. The Modeling Hub helps to evaluate changes to response capabilities involving medical countermeasures and to identify and quantify the effect that additional response assets can provide. The Modeling Hub also assists in prioritizing research investments at BARDA and evaluates the impact of policy decisions to minimize adverse medical and public health consequences. The Modeling Hub produces in-depth assessments, reports and visualization tools to guide decision-making within BARDA's senior staff and among ASPR's public health officials and policy makers. This is achieved by modeling the medical and public health consequences of historical and potential incidents of CBRN, influenza and emerging infectious diseases that may benefit from the intervention of medical countermeasures and innovations in the public health response system. The Modeling Hub's activities inform and support Project BioShield and pandemic influenza planning and requirements for decision making. Per the direction of The 2005 National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan, BARDA and the Analytical Decision Support group have the responsibility for managing the Modeling Hub to provide real-time mathematical modeling, simulation and analysis designed to assess alternative policy and procurement options for medical countermeasures and emergency public health planning and response for decision making.

BARDA’s Strategic Plan (2011) set a goal to provide assistance to developers through core assistance programs in critical areas including animal and clinical studies to obtain safety and efficacy data and manufacturing optimization, validation, and scale-up for clinical studies and commercial launch. In 2011 BARDA established the Non-clinical Studies Network comprised of 17 laboratories in the U.S. and UK that have perform studies supporting the natural history of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear events in multiple animal models and the safety and efficacy afforded by different medical countermeasures supportive of FDA Approval. The Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) were established in 2012. The three Centers are located in the U.S. and are comprised of industry, academic, and Sate government entities partnered with BARDA. BARDA established in 2013 a Fill Finish Manufacturing Network (FFMN) to assist medical countermeasure developers with final drug product manufacturing (e.g., aseptic syringe and vial filling, lyophilization), support national pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing efforts and other public health emergencies. The FFMN is comprised of four domestic manufacturers with a broad set of capabilities to address every day and emergency needs Lastly BARDA established a Clinical Studies Network (CSN) in 2014 to provide clinical study services from designing clinical protocols to managing clinical trial sites. The five domestic Clinical Research Organizations in the Clinical Studies Network will provide these services to medical countermeasure developer partnered with BARDA and backfill NIH’s clinical study capabilities in a public emergency as requested.

"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/stories/ebola-story/","Global collaboration with BARDA scientists successfully develop Ebola countermeasures","Products supported by BARDA used to halt 2021 outbreaks","U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Emergency Login | Register X I WANT TO FIND Search FEATURED SEARCHES: Coronavirus BARDA Industry Day PRISM TechWatch Announcements & Media BARDA Global collaboration with BARDA scientists successfully develop Ebola countermeasures Products supported by BARDA used to halt 2021 outbreaks June 21, 2021 Ever since the 1918 pandemic influenza outbreak, public health scientists have sought to identify emerging infections and control them before major outbreaks occur. The principles of identifying, containing, and preventing outbreaks have been the foundation of public health for over 100 years. However, the growth of global travel challenges traditional interventions --pathogens do not respect borders. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate this dramatically, but the current pandemic is not the only recent example. When dozens of people were sick with Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in rural southeast Guinea in West Africa in March 2014, physicians and other experts from around the world converged both to care for people in the outbreak regions and to contain the often-lethal disease before it spread to other countries or continents. By July 2014, the outbreak spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone and was detected in the capitals of all three countries. This was the first time Ebola had spread to urban population centers, raising the risk of international spread. The response to the 2014 Ebola outbreaks was limited both by the poor public health infrastructure in the outbreak areas and the lack of effective medical countermeasures. In 2014, the world had only limited diagnostic tests for Ebola, and vaccines and therapeutics had not yet reached clinical trials. By the time the outbreaks were halted in June 2016, at least 11,325 people had died, mostly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Only 36 cases and 15 deaths had occurred in other countries, indicating successful containment, but the risk of new outbreaks and a global emergency remained high. While hundreds of heroic healthcare workers cared for people during the outbreak and helped contain it, others put their energy into a global effort to develop medical countermeasures: Diagnostic tests to rapidly identify Ebola; Therapeutics to reduce deaths among people who get infected; Vaccines that can be administered to people at risk. Working with colleagues from across the U.S. government and the global public health community, the Ebola Medical Countermeasures Task Force at BARDA oversaw the research and development of therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tests. The effort began in earnest within weeks of the initial outbreak in 2014, with the rapid progression of nonclinical studies and manufacturing scale-up to support clinical evaluation of the most promising Ebola therapeutic at the time, the ZMapp monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. In parallel, BARDA partnered with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to leverage Regeneron’s rapid antibody identification platform to develop another candidate mAb-based cocktail. Similarly, BARDA ramped up investments in vaccines, supporting four different candidates that quickly progressed to clinical development. BARDA emphasized clinical development and manufacturing activities to ensure that we had safe and immunogenic candidates and that we had sufficient amounts of vaccines to conduct clinical trials. This resulted in three of the four candidates progressing into phase 2 or phase 3 clinical studies in Africa by 2015. In parallel with BARDA’s investments in therapeutics and vaccines, BARDA also invested in the development of rapid diagnostics for fast confirmation of Ebola Virus infection to inform safe and dignified burial practices. This was one of the most significant interventions to reduce Ebola transmission because traditional funerals were “super spreader” events during Ebola outbreaks. The Ebola virus can be transmitted to other people from close contact with the body of an individual who died from Ebola, so quickly determining whether a death was caused by Ebola is essential. In response to the Ebola epidemics and to protect the U.S. and global community, BARDA invested in the development of a rapid point-of-care test, developed in partnership with OraSure Technologies, Inc. Authorized for emergency use by the FDA in 2015 and the World Health Organization in early 2016, this rapid diagnostic test uses oral fluids to determine whether a person’s body is infected, giving responders the information they need to make more effective decisions in the field. As a result of this collaboration, the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test became the first FDA diagnostic to receive 510(k) marketing approval for Ebola in October 2019, and has been made available for use in recent Ebola outbreaks. BARDA’s task force included field work in Sierra Leone to devise appropriate storage and transport capability as well as to train local healthcare workers during the West Africa outbreak. BARDA also provided on-the-ground operational, clinical, data management, and other technical support to the STRIVE study, sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Sierra Leone College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences. This study, which evaluated the safety and immune response of the experimental rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine (brand name Ervebo®) manufactured by Merck in over 8,000 healthcare and front-line workers, was the first interventional clinical trial ever conducted in Sierra Leone. After the outbreak was declared over, BARDA continued to supply therapeutics for local flare-ups such as the 2016 cluster of cases in N’Zerekore, Guinea, and supported compassionate use of therapeutics in its portfolio in the U.S., Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda. BARDA staff conducted exercises in Sierra Leone to advance preparedness and worked alongside State Department, CDC, and NIH colleagues to coordinate across nations and non-government organizations involved in the Ebola response. Vaccines can be used during Ebola outbreaks so that, on an individual basis, family members, caregivers, and other contacts of infected individuals may be protected. Vaccines also improve the overall public health response by slowing or stopping ongoing transmission. As a result of the BARDA team’s work, there now are four FDA approved, cleared or licensed Ebola countermeasures – a rapid antigen test, a vaccine, and two treatments, and another vaccine authorized by European authorities. Merck’s ERVEBO became the first vaccine licensed by the FDA for prevention of Ebola in December 2020, Regeneron’s Inmazeb (EB3) was approved in October 2020 as the first treatment for Zaire ebolavirus infections in adult & pediatric patients, Ebanga (Ansuvimab/mAb114) treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD), from partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, LP, was the second therapeutic to earn FDA approval, in December 2020, OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen (diagnostic) Test by OraSure Technologies was cleared by FDA in 2019. An Ebola vaccine regimen by Johnson & Johnson (Zabdeno/Mvabea) was authorized by the European Commission in 2020. BARDA supported the advanced development and regulatory approvals of these products and worked directly with clinical and other partners on methods to rapidly deploy these medical countermeasures to communities affected in recent outbreaks. Three BARDA scientists who led the Ebola task force - David Boucher, Dan Wolfe, and John Lee - are among the finalists for this year’s “Service to America Medals” for their work developing and deploying effective countermeasures to Ebola. They credit more than three dozen other BARDA professionals who contributed to preparing for and responding to the threat of Ebola. That group includes members of BARDA’s clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, and contracting teams and project officers from BARDA’s divisions of CBRN Medical Countermeasures and Detection, Diagnostics, and Devices Infrastructure who came together in a matrixed fashion to build project coordination teams that provided-- and continue to provide -- industry leading expertise to all of BARDA’s development programs. In addition to this unrivaled expertise in advanced development and approval of medical countermeasures against national security threats, BARDA provided more than $700 million in funding for development of Ebola countermeasures. The combination of medical countermeasures enables healthcare responders to form a so-called “ring of protection” around Ebola patients and, in turn, reduce the spread of the disease while also treating patients so that their chances of recovery improve. Vaccines, designed to spur an antibody response within 14 days of a single dose, are given to family or others who are near Ebola patients. The antiviral therapeutics also significantly reduce Ebola deaths. “With unpredictable outbreaks, it’s critical to have a vaccine that acts quickly to protect that ring of contacts,” says Daniel Wolfe, BARDA’s CBRN vaccines branch chief. “Those vaccines were administered to family and other people close to a confirmed Ebola patient, while therapeutics were used to treat those already infected,"" explains David Boucher, chief of BARDA’s antivirals and antitoxins branch. ERVEBO, which originated as a project of the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, now is registered for use in eight African countries and is part of a global Ebola vaccine stockpile. BARDA provided funding and technical support for clinical trials, advanced development, and manufacturing of the vaccine starting in 2014 after Merck licensed the vaccine from NewLink Genetics Corporation. BARDA supported expansion of production in 2017, enabling Merck to supply vaccine for the response to both the 2018 and 2021 outbreaks. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was developed and manufactured with BARDA support that also began in 2014, uses some of the same technology as the company’s COVID-19 vaccine. Using a non-replicating adenovirus prime and a modified Ankara virus (MVA) boost, the vaccine regimen delivers a gene to the human immune system that prompts it to create antibodies and prevent infection. BARDA support included funding and technical advice for small scale manufacturing and phase 1 clinical development through the late-stage development of each of these countermeasures. In addition to the scientific and financial support, BARDA’s expertise with complex logistics also has been instrumental in the Ebola response. For example, BARDA scientists worked with local officials on ways to deliver Ebola vaccines and therapeutics under tight temperature control to remote areas. “These areas sometimes required a two-day drive from the nearest airport and often had unstable electrical power,” said Boucher. BARDA logisticians and scientists worked with other public health responders to devise innovative solutions and contingency planning. Another aspect of the BARDA Ebola Task Force’s work is applying lessons from Ebola to other potential health threats. In a paper published in the journal Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics, BARDA scientists outlined steps necessary to develop vaccines against other strains of Ebola or related viruses. “I don’t think I can stress enough how incredible it is to go from where we were in early 2014, having limited diagnostics and only preclinical stage vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola, to where we are today,” said BARDA Director Gary Disbrow. “We now have four FDA approved, cleared, or licensed BARDA-supported medical countermeasures to combat this horrific disease.” ABOUT “Ebola Medical Countermeasures Task force at BARDA” The Task Force group includes members of BARDA’s clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, and contracting teams and project officers from BARDA’s Divisions of CBRN Medical Countermeasures and Detection, Diagnostics, and Devices Infrastructure who came together in a matrixed fashion to build project coordination teams that provided-- and continue to provide -- industry leading expertise to all of BARDA’s development programs.

This partnership will leverage Dascena’s experience in developing improved prediction tools to advance the development of their COViage™ system, which received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to predict unstable blood pressure as well as respiratory failure, which requires ventilation in COVID-19 patients. Further clinical and user evaluation of the tool in additional hospitals will aid Dascena in expanding its use and availability across the country. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are at heightened risk of rapid health deterioration and severe outcomes. However, few scoring systems are available to help healthcare professionals predict COVID-19 patient prognosis. Dascena’s next-generation precision medicine approach analyzes data from the patient’s electronic health record to provide healthcare professionals with timely warning of COVID-19 patients at heightened risk of experiencing unstable blood pressure or respiratory failure. The advance notice would give healthcare professionals an important additional tool to guide interventional decision making, such as mechanical ventilation. Under this partnership, Dascena will advance the development of COViage through clinical validation of the technology to support a request for FDA 510(k) clearance of COViage and to conduct user assessments to aid in further expansion and implementation of the system at additional clinical sites. Dascena will complete a randomized controlled trial to prospectively assess the ability of the algorithm to predict respiratory decline.

To accomplish this goal, BARDA's Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Infrastructure maintained active public-private partnerships with U.S. licensed seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturers., as well as pandemic support for ancillary suppliers. These public-private partnership investments increased preparedness levels and response capabilities for influenza pandemic events. The Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Infrastructure has made significant achievements in recent years through cost-sharing public-private partnerships. In 2012, Medimmune's live-attenuated influenza vaccine manufacturing and filling capabilities in Santa Clara, CA and Philadelphia, PA were retrofitted to expand manufacturing at least two-fold. The 2014 retrofit of sanofi pasteur's influenza vaccine manufacturing facility in Swiftwater, PA increased its pandemic response capability to meet 25% of the Nation's pandemic influenza vaccine needs. BARDA and Novartis partnered to establish a new facility in Holly Springs, NC that utilized new cell-based vaccine and adjuvant technologies capable of making 33% of the Nation's pandemic influenza vaccine supply. This partnership resulted in the Novartis cell-based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax®) being licensed from this facility in 2014. BARDA support of Protein Sciences seasonal influenza vaccine at its commercial-scale manufacturing facility in West Point, NY, which received FDA-licensure of FluBlǾk® from this facility in 2015, increased further U.S.-based pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity. Lastly, BARDA's Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, which include the new Novartis facility and Fill Finish Manufacturing Network, were established as part of this infrastructure to expand domestic pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity. BARDA and its Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Infrastructure partners will strive to maintain pandemic preparedness capacity as Novartis Vaccines' influenza vaccine franchise transitions to BioCSL. Similarly BARDA will support the technology transfer associated with MF59 adjuvant manufacturing from Novartis to sanofi pasteur. These infrastructure programs, collectively, will continue to allow for rapid response to a pandemic through the use of public-private partnerships to maintain logistical capabilities, supply assurances, and domestic vaccine manufacturing capacities. BARDA's new National Medical Countermeasure Response Infrastructure incorporates many parts of the Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Infrastructure to address not only pandemic influenza but also emerging infectious diseases.

In partnership with the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Action Plan, BARDA used public-private partnerships to expand global vaccine manufacturing capacity, trained skilled workforces to make vaccines, provided in-country technical implementation assistance, and made available technology for scalable manufacturing. BARDA’s International Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Capacity Building Program has provided technical and financial support for influenza vaccine production to fourteen (14) manufacturers in thirteen (13) countries. Over 250 technical staff from these developing countries attended comprehensive vaccine manufacturing training programs at BARDA-supported academic institutions in North Carolina and Utah. BARDA continued to provide on-site technical support and advanced biomanufacturing training through North Carolina State University's Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center to ensure developing country workforces were able to implement production practices in their own facilities. BARDA also partnered with PATH to provide targeted technical support to manufacturers with influenza vaccines nearing eligibility for licensure. This program raised global preparedness levels for influenza pandemics from 1 to 300 million doses in 2005-2014. In addition, four seasonal influenza vaccines (with one receiving WHO pre-qualification) and seven H1N1 pandemic vaccines (with two receiving WHO pre-qualification) were licensed in six developing countries. The program garnered significant local support, with every dollar of BARDA funding leveraging seventeen dollars of local investment. Future objectives for the International Influenza Manufacturing Capacity Building Program include moving promising vaccines toward licensure and establishing regional production capabilities. In 2014, BARDA partnered with Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) of Seattle, WA to establish a hub to enable developing country vaccine manufacturers to produce adjuvanted influenza vaccines. This program could greatly increase pandemic vaccine production capabilities. BARDA continues to support targeted clinical trials, with special focus on manufacturers in Vietnam, Serbia and Brazil. BARDA also continues to fund the Biomanufacturing Training Program, with focus on training participants in National Regulatory Authorities to evaluate vaccines for licensure. Lastly, in 2015, BARDA supports sustainability transition activities, as the WHO GAP for Influenza Vaccines draws to a close in 2016. With continued financial and technical support from BARDA, these manufacturers should have the capability and capacity by 2016 to produce up to 500 million doses of vaccine to respond to a pandemic. The capability of developing countries to produce vaccine within their borders and as potential regional resources is critical to reduce the global threat of pandemic influenza, provide international stability and security, and reduce the burden on the United States to produce and distribute limited supplies of vaccine outside the country during a public health emergency.

(TRI), part of BARDA’s medical countermeasures clinical studies network, to support a large clinical trial as part of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) initiative, led by the National Institutes of Health. To meet Operation Warp Speed goals, this adaptive phase 3 clinical trial, named ACTIV-1, will evaluate three immune modulator drugs in treating hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health, will coordinate and oversee the clinical trial with funding and other support from BARDA; (TRI) will operationalize the clinical trial and provide other research support services. This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive trial, and beginning this month, the study will enroll approximately 2,100 hospitalized adults with moderate to severe COVID-19 at medical facilities in the United States and Latin America. The study initially will evaluate infliximab (REMICADE), developed by Janssen Research & Development, LLC, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson; abatacept (ORENCIA), developed by Bristol Myers Squibb; and Cenicriviroc (CVC), an investigational late-stage agent developed by AbbVie. Each agent will be evaluated as add-on therapy to remdesivir as the current standard of care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients . The research objectives are to evaluate each agent with respect to speed of recovery, mortality, illness severity, and hospital resource utilization. By structuring a clinical trial that uses an adaptive platform trial design to test multiple agents with shared control groups, the ACTIV-1 master protocol allows federal and private sector partners to act quickly, maximize investments in advanced research and medical countermeasure development, and obtain much needed answers to help guide clinical care of COVID-19 patients.

These Technology Readiness Level criteria allow a research and development program to be classified by its degree of maturity, from basic research about the mechanisms of a disease to the evaluation of a candidate countermeasure using animal models and clinical studies. The TRL format, previously developed by NASA and the Department of Defense, was adapted for use in these documents to specifically evaluate the development of medical countermeasures against both natural and man-made public health threats. The following TRL schematics are attached: Technology Readiness Levels for Medical Countermeasure Products: These TRLs are used when rating a medical countermeasures, such as a drug or a vaccine. Technology Readiness Levels for Product Development Tools: These TRLs are used when rating Product Development Tools (PDTs), such as assays, models, and reagents. The processes of developing medical countermeasure products or product development tools are two distinct but closely related endeavors. In order to successfully develop a medical countermeasure, appropriate effort and funding must be directed towards the maturation of the analytical tools and animal models that will be used during the medical countermeasure development process. Similarly, the necessary in vitro and in vivo assays and models cannot be fully refined and verified without a candidate product to provide a substrate for evaluation. Both of these development efforts must proceed in parallel in order to achieve an approved or licensed product. Furthermore, the regulatory approval and licensure process itself greatly benefits from reliable and reproducible analytical tools and animal models. These documents have been developed through the working groups of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise, and have been reviewed by subject matter experts at the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Specifically, they reflect the integration of TRL definitions previously developed by the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services. The scientists, physicians, and policy experts who have been involved in the creation of these criteria believe that they are an essential tool for researchers and product developers in the public and private sectors to consistently evaluate and communicate the status of medical countermeasure development programs.

In the race to identify safe and effective therapeutic treatments for the sickest COVID-19 patients, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense are engaging a non-profit research organization, Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative of San Francisco, on a phase 2 clinical trial that rapidly screens multiple potential drugs simultaneously. “Through our Operation Warp Speed partnership, we have worked feverishly with private industry to develop and make treatments available to reduce hospitalization, either shortening the length of stay or treating people with mild or moderate COVID-19 infections before they have to be hospitalized,” said Dr. Robert Kadlec, HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. “While we’re making significant progress, treatments to save lives of the sickest patients, such as patients in intensive care or on ventilators, remain an urgent need.” The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense on a $66.5 million agreement with Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative to add three investigational treatments to the research organization’s platform clinical trial. The agreement also doubles the number of sites where the organization is conducting their platform clinical trial, growing from 20 to 40 locations in the United States. A platform clinical trial uses the same protocol as a traditional clinical trial with a group of volunteers receiving either a placebo or an experimental product; but with a platform clinical trial, volunteers could receive one of several products being studied. Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative is using the approach for screening, with data reviewed frequently to eliminate ineffective treatments quickly and to move promising treatments quickly into later-stage clinical trials. Candidate therapeutics will be assessed by a panel of federal and academic experts to determine eligibility for inclusion in the trial. Promising results could position those potential treatments for late-stage clinical trials with private sector or inclusion in the ACTIV clinical trials led by the National Institutes of Health. Candidates will be selected that target the body’s response to the virus, known as host-targeted treatments, for the sickest patients. Other criteria include: the candidate’s development stage; the safety and efficacy data available to-date; available supply of the drug; realistic expectation that emergency use authorization could be granted during the current pandemic; and manufacturing capability that could get promising treatments to patients quickly. The single platform clinical trial approach is less costly and more efficient than traditional multiple clinical trials of a single drug candidate. The approach also allows researchers to compare the drug candidates head-to-head to identify which ones would be best for specific conditions or could be useful in combination. Such information would aid healthcare providers in making decisions about patient treatment.

BARDA’s Radiological/Nuclear MCM Program supports advanced development of therapeutic candidates for all aspects, illnesses and injuries that may result from a radiological/nuclear event, thus increasing preparedness to treat patients in both field and definitive care (hospital) environments. The BARDA Radiological/Nuclear MCM Program has supported development of over 35 candidates to treat the complex array of injuries, diseases and syndromes that can occur in patients after radiological and/or nuclear events. By collaborating with other key federal agencies that support basic research and early development (like NIH and DoD), BARDA has transitioned more than 20 MCM candidates into advanced development. Major accomplishments under Project BioShield include the late-stage development and procurement of recombinant cytokines (G-CSF and GM-CSF) in 2013, which are cell-signaling proteins used in treatment of neutropenia caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. The cytokine Neupogen® (G-CSF) received FDA approval in March, 2015 for the indication to increase survival in patients exposed to acute doses of radiation high enough to suppress bone marrow and immune system function. The approval was also granted to Neulasta®, a pegylated formulation of Neupogen® in the same year. In 2016, additional G-CSF and GM-CSF products were procured to increase our preparedness posture. The procurement of these anti-neutropenia cytokines exemplifies BARDA’s strategic goal of repurposing existing products as MCMs to leverage commercial development, distribution infrastructure and taxpayer investments in order to increase preparedness for radiological and nuclear threats. BARDA’s Radiological/Nuclear MCM development pipeline consists of ten (10) MCM candidates targeting traumatic injuries and acute radiation syndrome (including hematopoietic subsyndromes affecting blood-cell production and subsyndromes of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and skin) that may result from IND denotation. The Program also supports advanced development of a pediatric formulation for a licensed decorporation agent that can reduce internal contamination of radionuclides in children. The Radiological/Nuclear MCM Program also leverages the investments of BARDA’s new National MCM Response Infrastructure by collaborating extensively with the Nonclinical Studies Network on natural history studies, animal model development, evaluation of potential MCM candidates and efficacy assessments. For example, studies are conducted in appropriate scenarios and animal models to optimize the use of currently-available FDA-approved drugs, treatments and supportive care methods to treat patients with radiation subsyndromes. This Program also works with BARDA’s diagnostics and medical devices programs to support advanced development of biodosimeters that can determine whether or not an individual’s level of absorbed ionizing radiation requires definitive care. Through investments in MCM candidates that can help medical professionals triage patients and more effectively treat radiation syndromes and related injuries, BARDA will increase the Nation’s preparedness to respond to individuals in most need of critical care following a radiological/nuclear event. Future investments may include advanced development and regulatory approval of cytokines similar to G-CSF and GM-CSF from other manufacturers to diversify the market and increase competition. BARDA’s investments will continue support a robust armamentarium of countermeasures, optimized clinical management plans and well-trained communities of medical professionals and institutions capable of responding to radiological/nuclear threats.

BARDA and FirstString Research have partnered to repurpose Alpha-connexin Carboxyl-Terminal 1 (aCT1) eye drops as a potential medical countermeasure (MCM) against chronic eye injuries associated with sulfur mustard exposure. Under BARDA’s Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) Repurposing Drugs in Response to Chemical Threats (ReDIRECT) program, BARDA will provide funding for proof-of-concept studies to evaluate the therapeutic potential of aCT1 eye drops in preclinical models of sulfur mustard corneal injury. aCT1 eye drops is the second compound to be investigated as a repurposing candidate under the ReDIRECT program, a partnership between DRIVe and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) medical countermeasures Branch. aCT1 is a synthetic peptide that has been shown to promote wound healing and temper pathological inflammation in the skin and eye. A topical formulation of aCT1, called Granexin® gel, is in late-stage trials (Phase 2/3) for indications of cutaneous radiation injury, cutaneous scarring from breast reduction surgery, and thermal burns. aCT1 eye drops decrease inflammation (a common pathological response to chemical injuries such as sulfur mustard) and may promote regenerative ocular healing. Given that aCT1 displays anti-inflammatory effects for multiple indications within the field of regenerative medicine, the therapeutic potential of an ophthalmic formulation (aCT1 eye drops) will be investigated for long-term ocular injuries caused by vesicants (blister agents), specifically sulfur mustard. In the aftermath of sulfur mustard exposure, acute injury to the cornea often resolves on its own within a few weeks. However, in some patients, a chronic condition may arise later once treatment stops. This delayed, recurring corneal injury, known as mustard gas keratopathy, is typically irreversible and can result in blindness. Repurposing aCT1 as an MCM against mustard gas keratopathy has the potential to improve the quality of life after chemical exposure by preventing the loss of eyesight. These studies will aid in establishing rapidly deployable capabilities that can be used to reduce adverse health effects following ocular exposure to sulfur mustard.

OraSure’s rapid, point-of-care test will be available for use both in clinical settings and at home. This test could become the first for use at home in the United States. No instruments or trained personnel are needed to administer the test or read the results. Test results are available to the user in approximately 20 minutes. Currently there are no rapid POC tests available for large volumes of testing that can be used during times of quarantine and social distancing. This test is a quick, non-invasive antigen detection test that has the potential to be deployed quickly to and assess symptomatic and asymptomatic acute infections shortly after the patient becomes infected. Availability of a POC test will allow people to be screened and triaged within minutes rather than waiting several days for test results. This test, which is built on OraSure’s OraQuick platform, will allow healthcare providers and agencies to distribute tests directly to an individual for testing, with the goal of minimizing exposure risks to others and reduce the threat of infecting others. Regardless if a POC or self-administered test, these early results would allow for faster diagnoses to enhance patient and community outcomes and quickly identify patients needing isolation. A rapid test would not only be a major step towards controlling this outbreak, but also benefit in preventing further spread of the virus by those infected. BARDA’s support for this project include funding of approximately $710,000 of the $1.2 million project costs and technical support in order for OraSure to request Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The development of animal models is a key element in the successful development of medical countermeasures for CBRN, influenza, and emerging infectious agents. The efficacy of products against most of these threats could never be verified using traditional clinical studies. In 2002, the FDA amended its regulations for drugs and biologics to permit approval or licensure of medical countermeasures based on substantial evidence of effectiveness in animals when adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies in humans cannot be conducted because it would be unethical to expose healthy human volunteers to lethal or disabling agents, and relevant field efficacy trials in humans are not feasible. This change in the regulations commonly referred to as the ""Animal Rule,"" made the design and conduct of adequate efficacy studies in appropriate animal models of paramount regulatory importance, since the inference of efficacy in humans is based on efficacy data derived in animals. In May 2011, BARDA awarded multiple contracts to establish the Nonclinical Development Network and facilitate development and qualification of animal models in support of the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear countermeasures in BARDA's portfolio. The goals of the program are: Development of models that meet the requirements to ensure regulatory compiance in support of BARDA's portfolio Reduction of project timelines and duplicative studies Testing and evaluation of already established products for potential use as MCMs (repurposing) Participation from and consultation with external partner AMIC members (NIAID, DoD, FDA) within the PHEMCE organization to maximize productivity and efficiency of the program A reasonably well-understood pathophysiological mechanism of the toxicity of the substance (agent) and its prevention/reduction by the test product The effect is demonstrated in one or more animal species expected to react with a response predictive of humans An animal study outcome that is clearly related to the desired benefit in humans Data on pharmacokinetics/dynamics of the product in animals and humans that allows selection of effective doses in humans Allow for the testing and evaluation of candidate medical countermeasures Use optimized/validated assays to monitor response and bridge data to humans The animal studies program is a component of BARDA's core services and is available to all of the operational teams within BARDA - CBRN, Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases.

The molecular diagnostic test from Hologic, Inc. becomes the first COVID-19 product selected for development through ASPR's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority streamlined selection process, called an easy broad agency announcement (EZ-BAA). ""Early, rapid diagnosis is essential for clinicians and their patients to treat infections appropriately and take immediate action to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19,"" said BARDA Director Rick Bright, Ph.D. ""While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our nation's public health laboratories are making valiant efforts in testing and surveillance of coronavirus infections, these labs could become overwhelmed as the number of suspected cases grows. Rapid, high-throughput tests are critical to provide quick results for more Americans and to aid the nationwide public health response."" BARDA will contribute $699,000 to accelerate Hologic's development of a test that detects the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Test results could be available to clinicians in less than three hours. BARDA and Hologic expect that necessary development will be completed in a matter of weeks which then would allow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider granting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the diagnostic test. An EUA facilitates the availability and use of medical products needed during public health emergencies. The test will be designed for use with the company's Panther Fusion system. The system is available today in commercial laboratories in the United States and other parts of the world. This Panther Fusion system provides complete sample-to-result automation with minimal user interaction and offers a broad menu of FDA-cleared tests to detect common respiratory infections. This existing infrastructure and supply chain would allow for rapid scale-up of the COVID-19 diagnostic test if the FDA issues an EUA, which would increase access to testing for more U.S. patients and healthcare providers in the fight against COVID-19. The business-friendly EZ-BAA application process streamlines the way BARDA collaborates with industry and entrepreneurs, enabling awards in as few as 30 days. BARDA recently opened the EZ-BAA for diagnostics that utilize platforms already cleared by the FDA, with a viable plan to meet requirements for the FDA to consider emergency use authorization. In addition to the EZ-BAA, BARDA expanded its standard broad agency announcement to accept proposals for advanced development of diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics and other medical products for use in the current COVID-19 emergency response and future coronavirus outbreaks. There are currently no approved diagnostics, vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 infections. However, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations of diagnostic tests from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other authorized public health laboratories, and for New York State's Wadsworth diagnostics test. In addition, on February 29, FDA also issued a new policy to help expedite the availability of diagnostics. HHS continues to work across the U.S. government, including with the Department of Defense, to review potential products from public and private sectors to identify promising candidates that could detect or protect against or treat COVID-19 for development and licensure. HHS divisions, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and ASPR, have begun supporting development of multiple vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. To obtain information about any potential products in development in the private sector that could be used in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. government launched a single point-of-entry website for innovators and product developers to submit brief descriptions of their diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other products or technologies being developed for COVID-19. To shorten the time to apply for product licensure and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, federal agencies are particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that have progressed beyond non-clinical studies, have established domestic large-scale commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing capability, and have utilized a platform used to manufacture a product already approved by the FDA.

Convalescent plasma is a blood product donated by patients that have recovered from COVID-19; the antibodies contained within the donated blood can be used as a treatment for patients still suffering from COVID-19. The antibodies also can be concentrated to produce hyperimmune globulin, a therapeutic product that is more uniform, allows for more flexibility in terms of dosing, and simplifies logistics administering the treatment. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for COVID-19. New therapeutic treatments, including convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin, are urgently needed for patients suffering from COVID-19. Grifols is currently part of the JPEO-CBRND’s Medical CBRN Development Consortium. BARDA and JPEO-CBRND are partnering through an interagency agreement to support the project, with BARDA providing $12.7 million. With BARDA’s project support, leveraging a separate partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, Grifols will collect plasma through a network of more than 250 plasma donor centers in the United States.

Whether COVID-19 can be transmitted through blood transfusions remains unknown, but BARDA has taken steps to mitigate any potential risk if it turns out the virus is active after a blood donation. That’s why, like we did in 2016 with Zika, BARDA is supporting further development of Cerus INTERCEPT Blood System. INTERCEPT Blood System is designed to reduce pathogens in red blood cells. BARDA now will support evaluation of this INTERCEPT Blood System platform to inactivate SARS-COV-2, just in case it is needed to protect the blood supply. This award is another example of BARDA’s ongoing strategy to leverage platform technologies, previously invested in by BARDA during past responses. By leveraging prior investments in platform technologies, BARDA can accelerate the rapid delivery of COVID-19 medical countermeasures. The INTERCEPT® System, approved for platelets and plasma, uses amotosalen - a well characterized photoactive compound that specifically targets DNA and RNA - and UVA illumination to irreversibly cross-link nucleic acids. In doing so, the INTERCEPT treatment blocks replication of many viruses, bacteria, and parasites, rendering them inactive. This system is approved for use in the United States for plasma and platelets. The system for red blood cells is still in development. BARDA funding will support the continued development.

Expanded access programs allow access to pre-approved drugs and therapeutic treatments such as convalescent plasma outside of a clinical trial setting. In this way, the expanded access program provides a framework for rapid access to a potential therapy for COVID-19. Individuals who recover from infections likely developed antibodies as part of their own immune response. These antibodies have the potential to bind the virus and neutralize it. Plasma containing antibodies can be collected from recovered individuals, and transfused into patients with active disease. Because this approach is simpler than developing an entirely new product, plasma can be used in clinical trials or under expanded access programs faster than new therapeutics or vaccines. Mayo Clinic is serving as the central Institutional Review Board (IRB) to oversee the expanded access program which includes patients at multiple hospitals across the country. This approach allows for rapid access when timing and access to potential life saving treatments is critical.

As a member of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE), the NIH is responsible for conducting research to better understand public health threats and establish a foundation for developing medical countermeasures. The Institutes and Centers within the NIH fund and conduct basic, clinical, and translational research to expand scientific knowledge and apply it to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. The NIH works in partnership with other PHEMCE members involved in the medical countermeasure enterprise. NIH research provides the foundation for developing medical products and strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent a wide range of infectious diseases, whether those diseases emerge naturally or are deliberately introduced as an act of bioterrorism. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is the lead agency at the NIH for research in the development of medical countermeasures for Chemical, Biological, Radiation, and Nuclear (CBRN) threats. NIAID supports research on viruses, bacteria, and other infectious agents that cause diseases of public health concern chemical threats, and radiological and nuclear threats. In addition, NIAID partners with other NIH Institutes and Centers, to coordinate research and programmatic activities related to medical countermeasure development. Research in Medical Countermeasure Development Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the subsequent anthrax mailings of that fall, NIH has played a key supportive role in the larger national strategy to develop medical products and strategies to counter bioterrorism and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. NIH focuses on basic and translational research. Basic research is needed to better understand infectious agents and mechanisms of chemical or radiologic injury and to identify therapeutic targets and drug candidates. Translational research advances promising concepts and product candidates along the development pathway. For example, research conducted and supported by NIH lays the groundwork for developing broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals-drugs that can prevent or treat diseases caused by multiple types of bacteria or viruses-and multi-platform technologies that could be used to more efficiently develop vaccines and diagnostics against a variety of infectious agents. This move from the ""one bug-one drug"" approach toward a more flexible, broad approach using sophisticated genomic and proteomic technologies has yielded numerous scientific advances and has equipped the United States with a much more integrated, coordinated approach to addressing public health crises. This was demonstrated during the SARS epidemic, pandemic flu preparedness efforts resulting from the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. NIH's medical countermeasure work supports the White House-mandated Concept Acceleration Program (CAP). CAP is one of four complementary initiatives designed to enhance and streamline the medical countermeasure (MCM) development process to develop promising, high-priority MCMs more rapidly. NIH supports research on MCMs against radiological and nuclear threats. These programs, part of NIH's larger medical countermeasures program aim to identify and develop new diagnostic tools and therapeutics to protect against and mitigate radiological injury. In addition, NIH coordinates a program on MCMs against chemical threats, a joint effort between multiple NIH Institutes and Centers. The overall goal of the program is to integrate cutting-edge research with the latest technological advances in science and medicine for a more rapid and effective response during an emergency.

By funding this manufacturing effort, the federal government will own the 100 million doses of investigational vaccine expected to result from the demonstration project. The doses would become available for use in clinical trials or, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or licenses (approves) the investigational vaccine, the federal government could distribute the doses as part of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. FDA can issue EUAs to facilitate the availability of an unapproved product only after several statutory requirements are met. For investigational vaccines being developed to prevent COVID-19, an assessment will be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinical trial data and the total scientific evidence available about the vaccine candidate. Additional analysis is required for FDA to license a vaccine. “Operation Warp Speed is creating a portfolio of vaccines to increase the odds that we will have at least one safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending on success in clinical trials, today’s $1.6 billion investment supports our latest vaccine candidate, being developed by Novavax, all the way through clinical trials and manufacturing 100 million doses for the American people.” This manufacturing demonstration project will take place while clinical trials are underway. Working in parallel this way shaves months off the traditional vaccine development timeline. This step builds toward the Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed goal to begin delivering 300 million of doses of safe and effective vaccine to the American people in 2021. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, collaborated with the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense and Army Contracting Command, to support advanced development, including clinical trials, and the manufacturing demonstration project. The project also includes fill-finish manufacturing in the United States so that vaccine doses are packaged and ready to ship immediately if clinical trials are successful and FDA grants an EUA or licenses the investigational vaccine. If these doses are used in a COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the vaccine would be available to the American people at no cost. As is customary with government-purchased vaccines, healthcare professionals could charge insurers for the cost of administering the vaccine. Today’s effort with Novavax builds on an agreement between DoD and Novavax announced in June. Under that approximately $70 million agreement, the company is manufacturing components of the vaccine in the U.S. and delivering 10 million doses of NVX‑CoV2373 that could be used in Phase 2/3 clinical trials or under EUA. NVX‑CoV2373 relies on a stable, prefusion protein antigen made using the company’s proprietary nanoparticle technology and includes Novavax’s proprietary Matrix‑M adjuvant to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Antigen stimulates the body’s immune response against the virus, and adjuvant enhances the immune response, reduces the amount of antigen required per dose, and improves the chances of delivering an effective vaccine that can be manufactured at scale.

This advanced serology effort builds on the Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) xMAP® SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay, which is a multiplex, microsphere-based, highly sensitive and specific assay that detects the presence of antibodies against three different SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This current test determines if a patient has previously had a COVID-19 infection. While the immune response to a past COVID-19 infection may protect against reinfection, an important aspect of understanding this potential protection is neutralization activity, or the ability of antibodies to bind with and prevent SARS-CoV-2 from interacting with human cells. Current methods of determining neutralization activity are time-consuming, expensive and not available for the clinical setting. To make estimates of neutralization more broadly available to healthcare professionals, Luminex is modifying the xMAP® SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG test. The team will compare the type and quantity of antibodies against three viral antigens – the spike protein, nucleocapsid, and receptor-binding domain – to the current “gold standard” measures of neutralization activity. The new test will run on the MAGPIX®, Luminex 200™, and FLEXMAP 3D® platforms. Having multiple diagnostic platforms available for COVID-19 testing provides patients, healthcare providers, and public health officials with reliable information to limit transmission of the virus, treat infections, and save lives. Upon successful development, the company will seek Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Accelerator Network Hybrid Events Do you want to attend BARDA Industry Day 2019 but can’t make it to D.C.? Don’t worry. We are happy to announce that our newly expanded Accelerator Network will be hosting hybrid viewing events across the country on October 15th. At these events, you’ll be able to view all of our general session presentations, network with your local colleagues, and get tips from our great Accelerators. See the table below for more details on local events and to find your nearest member of our Network (additional sites will be added as participation is confirmed). What are the Accelerator Network Hybrid Events? How do they relate to BARDA Industry Day 2019 in D.C.? Nothing can compare to being in D.C. for the full two-day BARDA Industry Day conference. However, we want to provide an opportunity for individuals across the country, who may not be able to make it to D.C., to learn more about BARDA and our partners. Therefore, our Accelerator Network will be hosting hybrid video streaming events at their locations, capturing all of our general session speakers on October 15th. Reference the specific Accelerator events for exact details about the hybrid event at each site. Accelerators in Eastern Time will livestream the event while Accelerators in other time zones may follow a locally-specific schedule. These special hybrid events will be an excellent local networking opportunity within our Accelerator communities! NOTE: Please only register for either the in-person BARDA Industry Day 2019 in D.C. or for an Accelerator Network Hybrid Event. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate requests for a combination of Network event attendance and in-person attendance.
