INTRODUCTION The mission of The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st Century health security threats. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) was established in 2006 to, through partnerships with industry, develop and procure medical countermeasures, vaccines, drugs, therapeutics, diagnostic tools, and non-pharmaceutical products, that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents, and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, BARDA supports the advanced development and procurement of drugs, vaccines, and other products that are considered priorities for responding to and recovering from threats to American national health security. The medical countermeasures and products in this diverse portfolio have received over 50 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, licensures, or clearances. Preventing and protecting against new health security threats requires breakthrough solutions. To address these new threats, ASPR and BARDA launched The Division of Research, Innovation and Ventures (DRIVe). The mission of DRIVe is to accelerate innovations, and improve the availability of transformative technologies and countermeasures to protect Americans from natural and intentional health security threats. To that effect, DRIVe is building an ecosystem of restless innovators that includes investors, companies, and research teams offering solutions to a broad range of national health security threats and health challenges. Additional information about DRIVe can be found at www.drive.hhs.gov II. PURPOSE DRIVe is seeking information on developments in anticoagulation drugs, assays, and management in the specific context of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. The intent is to identify areas of innovation that can solve the challenges posed by anticoagulation in ECMO or improve on the ways this issue is currently being addressed. BARDA will not execute any awards based on this notice. This RFI solely aims to gather knowledge on present and future capabilities and other pertinent marketplace data to strengthen BARDA’s understanding of the current developmental landscape of this field. This does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). DRIVe has not committed to investing in technological advances in ECMO. However, pandemics and other public health emergencies may lead to increased hospitalizations and emergency response, and technological interventions such as ECMO could aid in critical care and clinical management of patients. BARDA is performing market research to better understand opportunities for investment within the landscape of anticoagulation in ECMO. This may enable the implementation of a strategic approach should BARDA decide to prioritize the development or acquisition of technology to advance https://drive.hhs.gov/ http://www.drive.hhs.gov/ ECMO therapy. III. BACKGROUND Support for dysfunctional vital organs often relies on an extracorporeal vascular circuit. While experimentation with pumps and conduits began in the 19th century, two 20th century advances set the stage for support or replacement of organ function: the 1940s development of a semipermeable membrane suitable for the clinical exchange of water and small solutes and the refinement of membrane technology over the subsequent four decades to allow exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. These twin advances enabled complete (if temporary) substitution for renal, pulmonary, and cardiac function. They have also led to further innovation in clinical therapies, such as therapeutic apheresis and adsorption therapies. Extracorporeal circuits consist, at a minimum, of four elements: (1) vascular cannulae that partially dwell within the patient; (2) conduits that carry blood to and from site of extracorporeal handling; (3) the extracorporeal support that removes, exchanges, and/or returns a blood component; and (4) a pump that maintains flow. All extracorporeal circuits challenge the delicate physiological balance that maintains blood as a fluid, e.g. exposure of whole blood to foreign surfaces activates several processes that culminate in clot formation. The usual approach to managing this balance requires anticoagulation, namely the use of chemical or biological agents that inhibit one or more aspects of coagulation. While anticoagulation is usually considered in the context of the patient (systemic anticoagulation), some implementations of renal dialysis focus on regional (circuit) anticoagulation, and a few strategies attempt to minimize conduit activation through chemical bondings and coatings. None of these approaches to anticoagulation is entirely satisfactory. The normal balance between clotting and bleeding involves several interacting networks that act at the interface between blood and the tissue that contains it and also within the plasma. Anticoagulation requires perturbation of one or more aspects of these interacting networks. There are four general problems. • First, the anticoagulation is insufficient to the need. Extracorporeal formation of clot interrupts flow and function, and reperfusion of even small clots often culminates in life threatening embolization. • Second, anticoagulation can result in spontaneous hemorrhages, especially in the brain, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. • Third, anticoagulation is dynamic and must be frequently monitored and adjusted in order to minimize the risks of inappropriate clot formation and unwanted bleeding. Drugs that cause anticoagulation disrupt not only the coagulation network at their site of action, they also implicitly disrupt the various feedback loops that maintain normal balance. • Fourth, the need for ECMO support is often accompanied by progressive dysfunction of other organ systems (for example, hepatic and renal). Since ECMO addresses only cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction, managing anticoagulation can lead to unexpected adverse pharmacokinetics due to dependence on organ clearance and metabolism. This is further exacerbated by the fact that anticoagulation monitoring strategies are still largely episodic rather than continuous. More generally, the management of anticoagulation during extracorporeal support is labor-intensive, imperfect, and prone to complication. Currently, all extracorporeal therapies require near-continuous supervision by professionals trained in management of anticoagulation and its complications. That intense human oversight would be supported, improved, and possibly simplified not only by improved anticoagulation drugs, not only by mechanism-specific rapid anticoagulation assay, and not only by novel surface technologies, but also by use of closed loop titration of drugs enabled by artificial intelligence. BARDA believes that simplifying the management of anticoagulation of extracorporeal circuits with such innovations would lessen the need for high-skilled clinical staff to administer and could enable broader usage of ECMO and other therapies limited by coagulation. BARDA envisions a future in which ECMO could be conducted in ward settings, in which kidney hemodialysis could be conducted routinely at home, and so on. IV. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS & OBJECTIVES In this request for information, the public is invited to respond to the following prompts that are divided into new therapies and assays, management and automation, and material and design, as well as to share ideas that do not fit one of these prompts. 1.0 New therapies/assays: 1.1 The normal balance between clotting and bleeding is maintained by a delicate network that collectively regulates the activity of dozens of components including flowing blood elements (e.g. cells, platelets), plasma, and endothelial surface molecules. Systemic anticoagulation currently relies largely upon heparins and direct thrombin inhibitors, two drug classes that disable major components of that network. Moreover the assays of their effect—assays of the extent to which that network is compromised -- are imprecise and inconvenient. As a consequence, clinically serious derangements of the network—insufficient or excess anticoagulation states-- are often unnoticed until there is bleeding or clotting event. What other chemical or biological agents are currently being developed or evaluated to complement or replace these traditional methods? 1.2 Regional anticoagulation (often a citrate/calcium titration) has proven effective where flow rates are comparatively low (example, continuous renal replacement therapies) but have not been employed where the extracorporeal circuit demands high flow owing to challenges in titration efficiency and volumes of reagents required. Are there alternative approaches to regional anticoagulation potentially involving rapidly exchangeable small molecules such as dissolved gasses? 1.3 How does management of complementary problems—for example the formation of biofilms at the surface of indwelling cannulae—alter the tendency of blood flowing through or around those cannulae to coagulate? More generally, could management of such problems materially affect the challenge of anticoagulation management? 2.0 Management and automation: 2.1 Management of traditional methods of systemic anticoagulation usually involves testing of coagulation capacity by diverse methods including exposure to solid material (activated clotting time), conventional lab tests (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), direct effect measurement (such as anti -Factor Xa or ‘heparin’ level), and physical clot analyses (thromboelastography and viscoelastic coagulation testing). What, if any, alternatives are being developed or evaluated that would streamline testing and/or make the evaluation of anticoagulation status safer or more reliable? 2.2 Pumps are typically of continuous roller (lower flow, typically RRT) or centrifugal (higher flow, typically ECLS) design. Are there better pump programming options or better design options that would have an aggregate less disruptive effect on circulation and hence on the need for anticoagulation? For example, are there innovations that could reduce friction and heat generation that favor coagulation? Would there be less thrombogenesis with semi-pulsatile flow? 2.3 Are there strategies to separately address the risks of spontaneous hemorrhage that are caused by the need for anticoagulation but occur distant from the cannulation sites? For example, would—and how would—more precisely titratable reversal agents and the fine tuning they would enable affect the frequency and severity of bleeding and thrombosis? 2.4 What opportunities exist to automate the management of anticoagulation so that the current need for near continuous supervision and management might be lessened? 3.0 Material and design: 3.1 What opportunities exist to make (indwelling) vascular cannulae less thrombogenic? What refinements in coating or in physical design are being developed or evaluated to reduce the risk of coagulation or activation of coagulation during the brief transit from the intravascular site to the conduits? 3.2 Conduits, (including tubing, housings, and connectors) tend to have relatively slower flow velocities and prolonged surface contact. While heparin-bonding is approved, it is not universally used. Moreover, they seem to offer only transient benefit as those conduits undergo functional endothelialization and allow thrombogenesis. What opportunities exist to bond longer lasting alternative agents, or even to place catalytic agents to generate antithrombogactivities on these non- permeable surfaces? 3.3 The extracorporeal support—often a semipermeable membrane—is arguably the most critical element of the circuit. It typically requires rapid expansion of surface area to facilitate removal/exchange/replacement of blood-borne substances, an expansion that not only slows flow (to permit the exchange) but also sharply increases the opportunity to initiate thrombus formation on exposed surface. At the same time, the exchange process must be reliable and efficient, typically involving countercurrent flow of gas or liquid on the other side of the membrane. What advances in material, architecture, bonding and embedding are in development or testing that could substantially reduce the thrombogenicity—and thus the need for anticoagulation—at this critical point in the extracorporeal circuit? Can anticoagulants be generated or locally infused with reversal prior to reperfusion? Beyond the prompts above, what novel opportunities and approaches exist to minimize or eliminate the need for anticoagulation and thus remove one of the major barriers to expansion to these lifesaving methods?

Current vaccinations and therapeutics, involving injection of a liquid form via needle and syringe, place a tremendous burden on the healthcare system and supply chain, especially during a pandemic. Beyond the Needle is developing alternative technologies that aim to transform the paradigm making vaccines and therapeutics easier to administer and more widely available, without the need for needles, syringes, vials, and cold-chain distribution burdens. BtN Strategy Beyond The Needle Program Strategy Vision A world in which needles are no longer the default choice for vaccination or drug delivery. Mission Transform vaccination and other drug delivery by helping bring new technologies into market that offer alternative routes of administration so that needles and syringes are no longer the default modality, making them easier to administer, in a broader range of settings, without the need for needles, syringes, vials, and cold-chain transport. Specifically, Beyond the Needle aims to: Overcome the logistics burdens associated with manufacturing, storing, shipping and distributing needles, syringes, and other ancillary supplies, and also with cold-chain storage and transportation Increase immunization compliance, with pain-free, easier (possibly self-) administration and dose sparing for single-dose efficacy (vs. multiple boosters) Make vaccine more widely available, especially in resource-constrained settings and during a pandemic or other public health emergency where qualified healthcare professionals are in high demand and short supply Investing across the PARADIGM Show products:",,,

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW INFORMATION A. Development Opportunity Objective: Under these Special Instructions 013, BARDA is adding AOI #7 as part of its EZ-BAA (BAA-20-100-SOL-0002). Under this AOI, we are seeking abstract submissions for the following: AOI #7: ImmuneChip+ BARDA is requesting abstract submissions to support the development of advanced in vitro platforms that recapitulate components of vital human tissues and the immune system and their interactions. Abstract submissions that qualify for this funding will focus on engineering 3-D in vitro human microphysiological tissues (e.g. lung, liver, gut, or heart tissue) and immune system tissues on a single platform, while adding in-line sensors for continuous tissue monitoring and utilizing platform materials suitable for automated manufacturing. Specifically, Respondents should add immune system responsiveness to an existing, validated in vitro human tissue model (e.g. lung, liver, gut, or heart) and/or model infection with a viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogen, while demonstrating continuous monitoring of the tissues and capability for automated manufacturing of the platform. Respondents should consider the following when submitting their abstract: 1) Utilizing previously developed and validated MPS models of the human tissue and functionally enhance them by integrating relevant components of the human immune system (e.g. immune effector and/or regulatory cells) in a controlled way. Preliminary data should discuss the validation protocol within a single laboratory or multiple laboratories. 2) All MPS should mimic architecture, organization, multi-tissue interfaces, physiology, and disease pathology of the native human tissue. 3) All vital tissue-immune system MPS must be viable and functional for at least four weeks. Evidence of such achievement for previously developed tissue chips should be included in all proposals. 4) Proposed use cases may, but are not required, to center on infection of human lung tissue with a pathogen such as influenza or SARS-CoV-2. Proposals to utilize pseudoviruses will be considered. 5) The use of transformed or immortalized cell lines is discouraged. The use of primary cells, organ explants, or pluripotent stem cells, e.g., iPSC, is encouraged. Multipotent or unipotent stem cells also may be utilized where appropriate. Applicants should not use animal cells. 6) Choosing platform material(s) that are appropriate for automated production of the chips. Success will be demonstrated by using machinery to fabricate and assemble physical components of the platform and produce at least 25 platforms within 24 hours (without cell culture). 7) Each platform should include at least two different types of built-in biochemical sensors that enable continuous or near-continuous monitoring of the developing tissues for at least four weeks. Preference will be given to proposals focusing on monitoring physiologically relevant biomarkers, e.g. cytokines rather than the physical environment. Applicants should discuss the clinical value of the observed biomarkers. 8) Quantitative milestones and benchmarks should be described in the Research Strategy. 9) All awarded projects may be reviewed quarterly by an internal review committee comprised of federal staff from BARDA, NCATS, and NASA. The desired project outcomes are the following: Biological: 1) Integration of proposed disease models, where appropriate, with other organ systems to understand how tissue interactions influence disease pathogenesis, comorbidities, and treatment. 2) Inclusion of multiple immune elements (e.g., lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue). 3) Accurate reflection of human host-pathogen interactions, where appropriate. Functionality: 1) Demonstration of reliable operation of a minimum of two different types of built- in biochemical sensors that enable continuous or near-continuous monitoring of the developing tissues. Reliability should be assessed across the time domain (at least four weeks of continuous operation) and across multiple platforms, based on signal persistence or loss, and signal to noise ratio (if relevant). 2) Essential characteristics of the tissue models including all or some of the following features: (1) multicellular architecture that represents characteristics of the chosen tissue; (2) functional representation of normal and/or diseased human biology; (3) reproducible and viable operation under physiological conditions in culture for a minimum of four weeks; and (4) accurate representation of normal and/or disease phenotypes. 3) A bioengineered platform with spatial and temporal control of the cellular microenvironment, while enabling continuous monitoring through at least two built-in biochemical sensors for probing (direct in-cell measurements) and sampling (testing and continuous data collection and analysis) of the system. 4) Ability to identify new or test existing candidate therapeutics, where appropriate. Scalability and Manufacturing: 1) Choice of extracellular matrix material based on relevant biological properties and the potential downstream effects. 2) Biomaterials that can avoid confounding characteristics, e.g., the elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) binds hydrophobic drugs or reagents, which decreases the intended concentration, and can leach the endocrine disruptor cyclosilane into the medium. 3) Manufacturing scale-up should be demonstrated by providing evidence of reproducible automated production and, ideally, assembly, of at least 25 platforms within 24 hours. Production should occur under GLP condition, if relevant to the project and envisioned end use of the platform. B. Eligible Respondents & Scope Parameters: These Special Instructions 013 are open to all responsible sources as described in the EZ-BAA. IMPORTANT NOTE: Interested vendors must submit a request to schedule a market research call to ImmuneChipBARDA@hhs.gov to be considered for award. This request should include the project title, key project staff, and a brief description of the proposed project. Interested parties who do not submit this request will not be eligible for consideration. AOI #7 will be open for abstract submissions through 2:00PM ET on 30 June 2021, unless otherwise extended. Additionally, award(s) expected to be made under these Special Instructions 013 will be less than $750,000 in total Government funding. Funding is limited, so we encourage any interested vendors to reach out to ImmuneChipBARDA@hhs.gov as soon as possible before submitting an abstract. Abstract submissions that do not conform to the requirements outlined in the EZ- BAA may be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed. To clarify, an entity must have an active registration with https://beta.sam.gov at the time of submission to be reviewed. If not, submissions will not be reviewed and will be rejected. Please do not attempt to submit an abstract if your registration is not active in https://beta.sam.gov. C.

"https://drive.hhs.gov/immunechip.html",DRIVe,"DRIVe is transforming health security innovation to protect Americans from 21st century health security threats","ImmuneChip+ About ImmuneChip+ Tools that accelerate medical countermeasure screening and development are vital to improving human health – from enabling personalized medicine to responding to health security threats such as pandemics. To this end, BARDA, in partnership with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health, has launched the new ImmuneChip+ program. We aim to partner with innovators to support the development of advanced microphysiological systems / tissue chip platforms that integrate a component of the human immune system. The objective of the program is to develop a set of mature ImmuneChips, combining a previously validated model of a vital human tissue (e.g. lung, heart, kidney) with an immune system component, in a single platform that can be machine-manufactured and that includes multiple in-line sensors for long-term tissue monitoring. With this program, we aim to further enhance the usability of tissue chips and position them as useful tools in the drug development process and for personalized therapeutics. Overview FAQ Webinars Overview Accurately modeling human tissues and disease in vitro is a key step to accelerating the pace of drug discovery and development, a capability critical to effectively responding to pandemics, in which every day counts. Rapid advances in tissue chip technologies now make the prospect of commercialization more realistic. However, key challenges remain, including manufacturability, use of medically relevant sensors, and the integration of multiple tissue types anchored by the immune system. We aim to support the development of advanced microphysiological systems (MPS) that monitor and replicate components of vital human tissues, including immune system functions and their interactions. We expect that the use of these advanced MPS will result in unprecedented opportunities for addressing mechanistic questions of health and disease, as well as assessing biomedical interventions. Moving towards a comprehensive “body-on-a-chip” approach, these MPS will serve as a predictive tool in the drug development process and enable the development of precision medicine-based therapies. The focus of ImmuneChip+ is on engineering 3-D in vitro human microphysiological tissues (e.g. lung, liver, gut, heart tissue, or others) and immune system tissues on a single platform, while adding in-line sensors for continuous tissue monitoring and utilizing platform materials suitable for automated manufacturing. We are specifically interested in adding immune system responsiveness to an existing, validated in vitro human tissue model (e.g. lung, liver, gut, heart, or others) and/or model infection with a viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogen, while demonstrating continuous monitoring of the tissues and capability for automated manufacturing of the platform. FAQ Is the ImmuneChip+ program open to academics or do only companies qualify? It is open to both academia and industries as long as the respondents meet all the requirements described in EZ-BAA. Can large companies apply to the ImmuneChip+ program? Any entity can submit to ImmuneChip+ via the EZ-BAA portal as long as they are registered with www.SAM.gov. Can companies/universities outside of the United States apply for Immunechip+ funding? Yes. Applicants from outside of the United States are eligible to apply for funding. Please note though that U.S.-based manufacturing of the proposed solution device/diagnostic will be prioritized. Do academic institutions also need to provide a 30% cost share? Yes. Abstract submissions should include a cost-share that is within our target range of 30-50% minimum unless you satisfy the regulatory exception described (included below for reference). Currently, none of the awardees under the DRIVe EZ-BAA have been awarded a contract that does not include a cost-share component below range, including all universities and non-profit organizations. Cost-share may be in-kind or cash contributions. It may also come from a third-party investor/sponsor; however, it is up to you to ensure you receive their contribution toward the proposed project. Many organizations offer to cover Overhead or Fringe Benefits. Some also offer pro-bono labor hours or sponsored equipment, materials, or subcontractor costs. A combination of all of the above could be acceptable. It would need to be indicated on a submission what is being cost-shared. To qualify for no cost-share under an EZ-BAA award, a respondent must show that there is ""no probability that the respondent will receive present or future benefits from participation as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.303."" Examples of present or future benefits include increased technical know-how, training for employees, acquisition of goods or services, development of a commercially viable product that can be sold in the commercial market, and use of background knowledge in future contracts. What are the data-sharing requirements of the Immunechip+ program? ImmuneChip-funded projects have data sharing requirements with the U.S. government consistent with government regulation (FAR 52.227-14 Rights in Data). ImmuneChip+ program requires that you share all data (including raw data) generated under the project for government’s use consistent with the regulation. What state of technology development does the Immunechip+ program consider? The ImmuneChip+ program requires that all applicants already have a mature, validated tissue chip. Can you submit more than once and on multiple tissue areas? Yes, potential partners are free to submit more than one abstract so long as those projects are discrete, stand-alone projects, and all application requirements are met. The EZ-BAA application is so short. Can I include links to figures or references? While you can include links to figures or references, it is not mandated that reviewers view that outside information. At this time, the abstract format does not accept any figures, only text. All applicants are required to request a market research call prior to submitting an application.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW INFORMATION A. Development Opportunity Objective: Under these Special Instructions 009, BARDA is extending the closing date through 31 October 2020 for its temporary AOI #4: COVID-19 as part of its EZ-BAA (BAA-20- 100-SOL-0002). We are only seeking abstract submissions for the following: AOI #4.1-A: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-B: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-C: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-D: Remote Patient Monitoring/Remote Diagnostic Tools The development of adjunctive diagnostic technologies with near-term impact that are critical to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our health infrastructure during the COVID-19 outbreak. These technologies may empower the patient through providing a means of self-monitoring, or empower the healthcare provider through remote monitoring or evaluation and diagnostic capability throughout the care continuum of the patient (i.e. pre-hospital, inpatient, and post-discharge). There is also a need to rapidly assess and diagnose severity of illness in order to triage patients for care or to aid in early recognition of decompensation for improved clinical management of patient. These technologies may include, but are not limited to, smartphone mobile applications, wearables, or non (or minimally) invasive sensors that can measure/monitor host-signature or diagnose response to infection, telehealth applications, EHR based tools, algorithms that can predict, identify or prognosticate risk trajectories, clinical decision support software, or continuous monitoring devices. These technologies should be in advanced development and ready for clinical validation. These technologies should be capable of capturing and quantifying a broad range of host biological, immunological, biometric, clinical, laboratory, and/or physiological data. In addition, technologies that incorporate novel informatics approaches to data collection, reporting, and analysis are of interest. Pathogen- targeted and serology diagnostics, as well as bench-top diagnostics, are not of interest for this topic at this time. To be considered relevant under this topic, respondents should have a need to assess clinical validation through conducting a pilot study that meets the following requirements: 1) Total period of performance should have impact for this current COVID-19 outbreak. After clinical validation, technology should have the ability to be rapidly scaled and deployed under an accelerated timeline of less than 90 days. 2) Software tools should be able to be integrated into EHRs or deployed in less than 30 days. 3) Significant preliminary COVID-19 data to support utility of technology for COVID-19. 4) Requires minimal infrastructure or training to deploy and support. 5) Achieved FDA regulatory clearance/approval or have identified a clear regulatory path for deployment, if applicable to technology. 6) Demonstrates a clear commercialization strategy to expand use. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. AOI #4.2: [CLOSED] AOI #4.3: Alternative Routes of Administration (AROA) for Vaccines Vaccination saves millions of lives per year globally. It is the single most effective public health intervention for preventing infectious diseases. Traditional parenteral vaccinations using needles and syringes are the primary medical intervention for prevention of infections with these viruses. An identified risk during a pandemic response, including SARS-CoV-2, is the availability of needles and syringes used to administer vaccines. One key risk impacting needle and syringe availability in the United States during a pandemic is limited domestic surge manufacturing. In an effort to reduce production costs, the medical supply industry has evolved to “just-in-time” supply chain models over the past two decades. Industry has also moved sourcing and production of raw materials outside the United States. As a result, domestic availability of needle and syringes would be limited during an infectious disease pandemic. Another key risk is the limited number of qualified personnel needed to administer vaccine. Personnel trained in the administration of vaccine include physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical technicians, and pharmacists. In a pandemic where critical care personnel are likely to be in short supply, a successful alternative technology for vaccine administration would reduce the demand qualified personnel to administer vaccine. Enhancing the ease of vaccine administration would logically increase timeliness and vaccine coverage rates, reduce the number of infections, and mitigate mortality and morbidity rates during pandemics compared to current needle and syringe technologies. Alternative technologies for vaccine administration (oral, transdermal (i.e. micro array patches), and aerosol/inhalation), have the potential to eliminate the need for using the currently available needles and syringes during a pandemic response and hopefully self-administration. BARDA is seeking abstracts for the development of alternative routes of administration for vaccines (including oral, transdermal (i.e. micro array patches or aerosol/inhalation)) against CBRN threats, Influenza (seasonal/pandemic), SARS-CoV- 1 / 2, or MERS-CoV. Ideal attributes for vaccines delivered via alternative routes of administration would be single dose, room temperature stable, unadjuvanted and indicated for all populations. Vaccines delivered via alternate routes of administration would have similar or superior performance characteristics as traditional parenterally administered vaccines (i.e. safety and efficacy). Although the technology for alternate routes of administration of vaccines are not expected to adhere to TRLs, it is expected that the respondent obtains and submits an Investigational New Drug (IND) application upon completion of BARDA DRIVe funding for this project or the respondent shall make the vaccine available for potential toxicology and efficacy assessments under separate USG mechanisms. All submissions must include: 1) A vaccine candidate against CBRN threats, Influenza (seasonal/pandemic), SARS- CoV-1 / 2, MERS-CoV, or partnership with an antigen developer to be administered by an alternate route of administration. 2) Plans for IND enabling pre-clinical studies or provide existing data. 3) Product development plan. 4) Any regulatory communication with US FDA (pre-IND/IND). 5) Any pre-clinical or clinical data using this platform. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. AOI #4.4: [CLOSED] B.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW INFORMATION A. Development Opportunity Objective: Under these Special Instructions 008, BARDA is revising topic #4.3 immediately, and closing topic #4.4 at 1700 HRS ET on 04 June 2020 under its temporary AOI #4: COVID-19 as part of its EZ-BAA (BAA-20-100-SOL-0002). We are now seeking abstract submissions for the following: AOI #4.1-A: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-B: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-C: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-D: Remote Patient Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools The development of adjunctive diagnostic technologies with near-term impact that are critical to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our health infrastructure during the COVID-19 outbreak. These technologies may empower the patient through providing a means of self-monitoring or diagnosis, or empower the healthcare provider through enabling remote monitoring or diagnostic capability throughout the care continuum of the patient – i.e. pre-hospital, inpatient, and post-discharge. There is also a need to rapidly assess and diagnose severity of illness in order to triage patients for care or to aid in early recognition of decompensation for improved clinical management of patients. Current technology emphasis includes telehealth applications, wearables, non- invasive (or minimally invasive) sensors or algorithm-based tools. These technologies should be capable of capturing and quantifying a broad range of host biological, immunological, biometric, clinical, laboratory, and/or physiological data. In addition, technologies that incorporate novel informatics approaches to data collection, reporting, and analysis are of interest. To be considered relevant under this topic, technologies should meet the following requirements: 1) Ability to be rapidly scaled and deployed under an accelerated timeline of less than 90 days. Software tools should be able to be deployed in less than 30 days. 2) Ability to demonstrate potential utility for COVID-19. 3) Require minimal infrastructure or training to deploy and support. 4) Achieved FDA regulatory clearance/approval or have identified a clear regulatory path for deployment, if applicable to technology. 5) An innovative approach to addressing COVID-19 is preferred. 6) Manufactured components in the United States are desired. AOI #4.2: [CLOSED] AOI #4.3: COVID-19 Vaccine The development and broad delivery of effective vaccines are critical to combat the COVID-19 and other pandemic viruses such as avian influenza (H5N1/H7N9). Conventional vaccine delivery systems pose a supply-chain risk, require the use of adjuvants, biosafety and disposable concerns, and create barriers to self- administration and other ways modes of delivery to the broad public, nationally and globally. BARDA is seeking abstracts for the development of an alternative vaccine delivery platform to be used to administer vaccines on an accelerated timeline. Specifically, BARDA DRIVe is seeking to develop alternative routes of administration including self-administration (via the oral route and skin patches) that can deliver vaccines quickly, easily, and at a lower cost to large numbers of people. This combined with any novel formulation such as the use of single-dose, thermostable, and the unadjuvanted vaccine would be preferred. The novel formulation and alternative delivery could more effectively address national and global demand for vaccines in upcoming years while eliminating the potential need for adjuvants, minimize or reduce cold chain shipping and storage requirements, reduce or eliminate the need for vials, needles, and syringes and reduce medical waste. Additional benefits could include improvements to protection due to an enhanced immune response, improves ease of use, and improved deployment of vaccines to remote areas in both domestic and international settings. Ideally, preference will be given to technologies that have demonstrated the feasibility and/or immunogenicity either in humans or in animal models against Influenza (Seasonal/Pandemic), SARS-CoV-1 / 2, or MERS-CoV. Although the novel alternate delivery methods of vaccines are not expected to adhere to TRLs, it is expected that the offeror obtains and submits an Investigational New Drug (IND) application upon completion of BARDA DRIVe funding for this project including qualification of all release assays necessary to demonstrate the safety of candidate product as well as any associated toxicology studies necessary for the IND filing. • All responsive submissions must have demonstrated, ideally prior to submission, sufficient proof of concept, technology transfer, and IND-enabling studies completed including demonstration of a robust upstream development process and scalable downstream purification process. • All submissions must bring forth a vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza viruses with pandemic potential along with a new method or route of administration other than traditional administration and delivery vehicles for these vaccines. The alternative delivery vehicle should provide clear integration into the fill/finish component of vaccines and studies in support of this should ideally be completed prior to submission. • Abstracts will be evaluated based upon the demonstration of scalability of process, antigen-sparing effects, dosing, ease of use, long term thermostability, and cost as compared to traditional vaccination routes. • The manufacturing technology for the proposed vaccine should be suitable for commercial-scale production and product delivery. • Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. AOI #4.4: Advanced Manufacturing Technologies [CLOSING on 04 June 2020] The development and demonstration of innovations and enhancements to manufacturing platforms to support the development of necessary medical countermeasures including vaccines and therapeutics in prevention, preparation, and response to COVID-19. The purpose of the innovations and enhancement to advanced manufacturing technologies may include, but are not limited to, improving pharmaceutical quality, rapidly scaling manufacturing capabilities, shortening supply chains, increasing manufacturing resilience to disruption, accelerating availability of emerging therapies/vaccines, or reducing the risk of pharmaceutical shortages. Advanced manufacturing technologies may include, but are not limited to, continuous manufacturing and additive manufacturing (including 3D printing).

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW INFORMATION A. Development Opportunity Objective: Under these Special Instructions 011, BARDA is adding AOI #5 as part of its EZ-BAA (BAA-20-100-SOL-0002). Under this AOI, we are seeking abstract submissions for the following: AOI #5: ReDIRECT (Repurposing Drugs In Response to Chemical Threats) The availability of effective medical countermeasures (MCMs) against chemical threats are critical in the treatment of their acute health effects. Necessary attributes of effective MCMs against chemical threats include ease of administration during a mass-casualty situation and rapid efficacy as a post-exposure therapy. Drug repurposing is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for FDA approved or late-stage investigational therapeutics that are outside of their original clinical indication. The identification of existing compounds for repurposing as MCMs holds the potential to expand current response capabilities to chemical threats, as well as potentially mitigating the costs and risks associated with conventional drug discovery. BARDA is requesting abstract submissions for projects that repurpose existing therapeutics as MCMs against chemical threats (cyanide, opioids, nerve agents, chlorine, sulfur mustard, etc.). These therapeutics should have a strong mechanistic justification for potential use as MCMs. Ideal candidates for MCMs should have a known safety profile from previous clinical indications or development and be safe and effective for the entire population, including at-risk populations such as pediatrics, geriatrics, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. MCM candidates should: 1) Already be approved or in late-stage clinical development for a conventional indication similar to the symptomology associated with exposure to a chemical agent; and 2) Utilize improved delivery routes or mechanisms that provide ease of administration (including, but not limited to, reformulation of existing products) to large numbers of exposed individuals during mass casualty situations. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. Therapeutics that are eligible for drug repurposing may target any of the following: Pulmonary Agents: Development of MCMs to prevent and treat lung damage (including pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, and fibrosis) resulting from exposure to agents such as chlorine, sulfur mustard and phosgene. Opioids: Development of MCMs to treat life-threatening respiratory depression caused by opioid overdose. These post-exposure treatments should be quick-acting and effective against a variety of opioids, including synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl. Candidates should have a mechanism of action different from existing opioid receptor antagonists. Vesicants: Development of MCMs that limit harmful aspects of exposure to vesicating agents such as sulfur mustard and Lewisite. Particular preference is given to drugs with potential to ameliorate the long term effects of exposure including Mustard Gas Keratopathy. Blood/Metabolic Agents: Development of MCMs to treat acute poisoning from agents such as cyanides. Antidotes should be easily administered by first responders in personal protective equipment. Preference is given to those cyanide antidotes that are also effective against smoke inhalation-related exposure. Nerve Agents and Organophosphorus (OP) Pesticides: Development of MCMs to treat life-threatening and long-term effects of nerve agents and OP pesticides. Antidotes should be easily administered by first responders in personal protective equipment. Computational approaches to identify candidates for drug repurposing: Development of improved methods to rapidly identify FDA approved or late stage candidate compounds that can be repurposed against any of the aforementioned chemical threats. To be considered responsive under this AOI, respondents should have: 1) A drug that is a candidate for repurposing as a MCM against pulmonary agents, opioids, vesicants, blood/metabolic agents, nerve agents, or organophosphate pesticides; and 2) A FDA approved drug, or one that has completed Phase 2 trials as evidenced by a clinical study report; and 3) A clear rationale as to why the candidate would be efficacious as a chemical MCM. Priority will be given to MCMs developed in the United States. B.

During a chemical emergency, minutes matter and a rapid response is necessary to save lives. In partnership with the Chemical Medical Countermeasures Branch in BARDA, the DRIVe ReDIRECT program aims to partner with innovators to repurpose commonly available therapeutics to treat conditions resulting from exposure to chemical agents and enable a rapid response. Overview Focus Areas FAQ Overview Chemical threats often occur without warning with injury or death often occurring shortly after exposure. Exposure can occur through terrorist attacks, industrial accidents, or transportation accidents, and require the rapid deployment of medical counter measures (MCMs) to minimize injury. The availability of effective MCMs against chemical threats are critical in the treatment of their acute health effects following exposures. However, centralized stockpiling in preparation for a chemical emergency – despite working well for some incidents – is often impractical for immediate deployment in response to these events where minutes matter. The ideal MCMs is easily administered in a mass-casualty situation and has rapid efficacy as a post-exposure therapy, however it needs to be easily accessible within hospitals, pharmacies, and the community. Drug repurposing, or label expansion, is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for FDA approved or late-stage investigational therapeutics that are outside of their original clinical indication. The identification of existing compounds for repurposing as MCMs holds the potential to expand current response capabilities to chemical threats, as well as potentially mitigating the costs and risks associated with conventional drug discovery. Repurposing drugs will ensure that these therapeutics are easily accessible during an emergency and reduce the reliance on centralized stockpiles or logistically-challenging forward deployment programs. Approach: Drug repurposing efforts for the ReDIRECT Program are based on a “treat the symptom” approach that is agnostic to the chemical injury itself. Candidates for repurposing will focus on treating the symptoms associated with exposure to the chemical threat, rather than the agent. Goal: The BARDA Chemical MCM Program, in partnership with the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe), aims to identify early- and late-stage therapeutic candidates for development as MCMs against a range of chemical threats. Focus Areas The ReDIRECT program is focused on repurposing therapeutics against any of the following agents: Pulmonary Agents: Development of MCMs to prevent and treat lung damage (including pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, and fibrosis) resulting from exposure to agents such as chlorine, sulfur mustard and phosgene. Opioids: Development of MCMs to treat life-threatening respiratory depression caused by opioid overdose. These post-exposure treatments should be quick-acting and effective against a variety of opioids, including synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl. Candidates should have a mechanism of action different from existing opioid receptor antagonists. Vesicants: Development of MCMs that limit harmful aspects of exposure to vesicating agents such as sulfur mustard and Lewisite. Particular preference is given to drugs with potential to ameliorate the long term effects of exposure including Mustard Gas Keratopathy. Blood/Metabolic Agents: Development of MCMs to treat acute poisoning from agents such as cyanides. Antidotes should be easily administered by first responders in personal protective equipment. Preference is given to those cyanide antidotes that are also effective against smoke inhalation-related exposure. Nerve Agents and Organophosphorus (OP) Pesticides: Development of MCMs to treat life-threatening and long-term effects of nerve agents and OP pesticides. Antidotes should be easily administered by first responders in personal protective equipment. Computational approaches to identify candidates for drug repurposing: Development of improved methods to rapidly identify FDA approved or late stage candidate compounds that can be repurposed against any of the aforementioned chemical threats. FAQ What is out of scope of the ReDIRECT program? The ReDIRECT program is NOT interested in the development of new drugs as medical countermeasures. We are however interested in reformulation of existing drugs that are approved in any country as long as there are no safety issues, the offerer has freedom to operate given the intellectual property status of the proposed therapeutic, and there is currently a clear commercial indication. What is within scope of the ReDIRECT program? The ReDIRECT program is only interested in therapeutics that are either (1) passed Phase 2 or are in undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials for their primary indications, or (2) FDA-approved for their primary indication. The purpose of the program is to repurpose existing therapeutics that are easily accessible in the community as medical counter measures. Can ReDIRECT projects be awarded to academic, or do only companies qualify? Yes, as long as the respondent meets all the requirements described in EZ=BAA, which includes a clear path to product/ technology development. Can large companies apply to ReDIRECT? Any entity can submit to ENACT via the EZ-BAA portal as long as they are registered with www.beta.SAM.gov. May an institution submit more than one proposal on behalf of investigators/teams? Is there a limit to the number of proposal that may be submitted by an institution? An institution is currently allowed to submit more than one abstract on behalf of investigators, or teams. There is currently no limit to the number of abstracts received by an offeror. It is recommended that an offeror submit only their best products for consideration with the potential to radically transform Health Security. Can companies/universities outside of the United States apply for ReDIRECT funding? Yes. Applicants from outside of the United States are eligible to apply for funding. Please note though that U.S.-based manufacturing of the proposed solution will be prioritized. Do universities also need to provide a 30% cost share? Yes. Abstract submissions should include a cost-share that is within our target range of 30-50% minimum, unless you satisfy the regulatory exception described (included below for reference). Currently, none of the awardees under the DRIVe EZ-BAA have been awarded a contract that does not include a cost-share component below range, including all universities and non-profit organizations. Cost-share may be in-kind or cash contributions. It may also come from a third party investor/sponsor; however it is up to you to ensure you receive their contribution toward the proposed project. Many organizations offer to cover Overhead or Fringe Benefits. Some also offer pro-bono labor hours or sponsored equipment, materials, or subcontractor costs. A combination of all of the above could be acceptable. It would need to be indicated on a submission what is being cost-shared. In order to qualify for no cost-share under an EZ-BAA award, a respondent must show that there is ""no probability that the respondent will receive present or future benefits from participation as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.303."" Examples of present or future benefits include increased technical know-how, training for employees, acquisition of goods or services, development of a commercially viable product that can be sold in the commercial market and use of background knowledge in future contracts. Is follow-on funding available once ReDIRECT-funded EZ-BAA projects are completed? Projects completed under ReDIRECT funding are NOT guaranteed additional funding from any government source (including ReDIRECT). However, if a therapeutic demonstrates significant potential, additional funding opportunities may be available for advanced development through the BARDA Broad Agency Announcement. The EZ-BAA abstract is so short. Can I include links to figures or references? While you can include links to figures or references, it is not mandated that reviewers view that outside information. At this time, the abstract format does not accept any figures, only text. What resources are available to applicants in technical and business development? Applicants are welcome to consult with DRIVe’s Accelerator network, which provides wraparound technical and business development support services. Can you submit more than once and on multiple targets? Yes, potential partners are free to submit more than one abstract so long as those projects are discrete, stand-alone projects. What stage of development for therapeutics does ReDIRECT consider? It is preferred that therapeutics are either FDA-approved or in late stage Stage 2/3 clinical trials for their primary indication. Additional data to support the secondary indication as a medical counter measure against a chemical threat is preferred. What options are available for proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate a therapeutics’ efficacy against a chemical threat? Applicants have two options: Share their therapeutic with BARDA through a Material Transfer Agreement for testing in the BARDA Non-Clinical Network. These studies are conducted at no cost to you. Apply for funding through the DRIVe EZ-BAA to conduct their own proof-of-concept studies.",,,

A potentially life-threatening medical emergency, sepsis is the body’s extreme response to an infection. All roads can lead to sepsis. It can arise from any infection that triggers a chain reaction throughout the body. To be prepared against health security threats, we need to address sepsis directly. Without timely treatment, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. At least 1.7 million adults in the U.S. develop sepsis each year. That’s more than the number of people who have heart attacks and strokes combined. W H A T S O L V I N G S E P S I S I S D O I N G The Solving Sepsis Program is committed to a multi-pronged approach to combat sepsis. Greater than 80% of patients that develop sepsis acquire it in the community. For every hour appropriate treatment is delayed, the likelihood of death increases. To ensure everyone gets the right care at the right time, we are addressing the entire continuum of care of a sepsis patient — from early pre-hospital interactions with healthcare providers, through hospital care and discharge – seeking innovative interventions at each step to reduce sepsis mortality. We are leading change by forming innovative and critical partnerships across the U.S. government and with external partners to take a systems approach towards solving pediatric and adult sepsis through the development of the following products: • Diagnostics, medical devices, and wearables that can predict and identify sepsis — for use in physician offices, emergency rooms, hospital wards, nursing facilities, and even the home. • Software that uses artificial intelligence/machine learning to monitor, predict, diagnose, and prognosticate trajectory of sepsis in the pre-hospital, inpatient, and post-discharge settings. • Precision medicine treatment approaches and clinical management plans that harness large-scale data to address the complex nature of sepsis. • Training to raise awareness and educate on sepsis among healthcare professionals and promote the use of new technologies in clinical settings.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases are critical to both the patient and the broader community. ENACT (Early Notification to Act, Control, and Treat) partners with innovators to develop disruptive technologies that detect, prognosticate outcomes, and enable early intervention following exposures to both natural and man-made infectious threats. To learn more about the ENACT program, please see more on the ENACT Program Factsheet. Watch an introduction to the program, presented to the Digital Medicine Society on September 9, 2020 ENACT Program Strategy FAQ Webinars ENACT News ENACT Program Strategy Vision ENACT endeavors to upend the traditional doctor-patient paradigm by empowering patients, health-care providers, and public health organizations with early and actionable health status information. By supporting the development of novel sensors and data analytics approaches, ENACT aims to provide information that enables early indication of infection, reduces illness spread in an epidemic, enables faster diagnostics, improves adherence monitoring and intervention in clinical trials, and efficiently allocates medical resources. Mission ENACT helps develop accessible technological solutions that provide early and actionable health status information to empower the individual, health-care provider, and public health organizations to rapidly act, control, and treat infectious diseases. To this end, ENACT partners with academic and private sector teams to support research and development of novel physiological sensors, telehealth, and data analytics platforms. Strategy Develop noninvasive wearable and on-demand physiological and biomarker detectors that monitor physiological changes from the user’s baseline Identify robust algorithms that analyze the resulting clinical data and detect health and illness signatures Develop software platforms capable of detection changes in individual and population-wide health status Identify the key markers of health status for enabling high-accuracy presymptomatic detection of infection Investing across the PARADIGM Show products: FAQ Please carefully read the ENACT area of interest in the EZ-BAA solicitation on beta.sam.gov located here. If you have any questions not answered in the solicitation or in these Frequently Asked Questions below, please email Enact@hhs.gov Can ENACT projects be awarded to academics, or do only companies qualify? Yes, as long as the respondent meets all the requirements described in EZ=BAA, which includes a clear path to technology development. Can large companies apply to ENACT? Any entity can submit to ENACT via the EZ-BAA portal as long as they are registered with www.SAM.gov. May an institution submit more than one proposal on behalf of investigators/teams? Is there a limit to the number of proposals that may be submitted by an institution? An institution is currently allowed to submit more than one abstract on behalf of investigators, or teams. There is currently no limit to the number of abstracts received by an offeror. It is recommended that an offeror submit only their best products for consideration with the potential to radically transform Health Security. Can companies/universities outside of the United States apply for ENACT funding? Yes. Applicants from outside of the United States are eligible to apply for funding. Please note though that U.S.-based manufacturing of the proposed solution device/diagnostic will be prioritized. Do universities also need to provide a 30% cost share? Yes. Abstract submissions should include a cost-share that is within our target range of 30-50% minimum, unless you satisfy the regulatory exception described (included below for reference). Currently, none of the awardees under the DRIVe EZ-BAA have been awarded a contract that does not include a cost-share component below range, including all universities and non-profit organizations. Cost-share may be in-kind or cash contributions. It may also come from a third party investor/sponsor; however it is up to you to ensure you receive their contribution toward the proposed project. Many organizations offer to cover Overhead or Fringe Benefits. Some also offer pro-bono labor hours or sponsored equipment, materials, or subcontractor costs. A combination of all of the above could be acceptable. It would need to be indicated on a submission what is being cost-shared. In order to qualify for no cost-share under a EZ-BAA award, a respondent must show that there is ""no probability that the respondent will receive present or future benefits from participation as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.303."" Examples of present or future benefits include increased technical know-how, training for employees, acquisition of goods or services, development of a commercially viable product that can be sold in the commercial market and use of background knowledge in future contracts. What are the data sharing requirements of ENACT? ENACT-funded projects have data sharing requirements with the U.S. government consistent with government regulation (FAR 52.227-14 Rights in Data). ENACT requires that you share all data (including raw data) generated from an under the project for government’s use consistent with regulation. Such data sharing typically does NOT include algorithms developed by ENACT partners. Is follow-on funding available once ENACT funded EZ BAA projects are completed? Projects completed under ENACT funding are NOT guaranteed additional funding from any government source (including ENACT). Can ENACT identify partners for us to complete the work envisioned? No. The government does not suggest or requiring any specific partnerships and will not provide match-making services. Does ENACT fund diagnostics? At this time host based diagnostics are considered, but pathogen detection technologies are not considered to be within scope. Host based platforms should be targeted for use as wearables or at-home, and should not be designed specifically for use in doctor’s offices or clinics. What stage of technology development does ENACT consider? While there is no required starting TRL (technology readiness level), it is preferred that projects are close to ready for commercialization by the end of the funding period. Is FDA engagement required for ENACT projects? While FDA approval is typically not required by end of project, engagement with FDA typically is, but this depends on the proposed project. Are templates of successful ENACT abstracts available? ENACT cannot provide sample abstracts. Can you submit more than once and on multiple targets? Yes, potential partners are free to submit more than one abstract so long as those projects are discrete, stand-alone projects. The EZ-BAA abstract is so short. Can I include links to figures or references? While you can include links to figures or references, it is not mandated that reviewers view that outside information. At this time, the abstract format does not accept any figures, only text. What resources are available to applicants in technical and business development? Applicants are welcome to consult with DRIVe’s Accelerator network, which provides wraparound technical and business development support services.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW INFORMATION A. Development Opportunity Objective: Under these Special Instructions 010, BARDA is adding topic #4.1-E under its temporary AOI #4: COVID-19 as part of its EZ-BAA (BAA-20-100-SOL-0002). We are only seeking abstract submissions for the following: AOI #4.1-A: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-B: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-C: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-D: Remote Patient Monitoring/Remote Diagnostic Tools The development of adjunctive diagnostic technologies with near-term impact that are critical to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our health infrastructure during the COVID-19 outbreak. These technologies may empower the patient through providing a means of self-monitoring, or empower the healthcare provider through remote monitoring or evaluation and diagnostic capability throughout the care continuum of the patient (i.e. pre-hospital, inpatient, and post-discharge). There is also a need to rapidly assess and diagnose severity of illness in order to triage patients for care or to aid in early recognition of decompensation for improved clinical management of patient. These technologies may include, but are not limited to, smartphone mobile applications, wearables, or non (or minimally) invasive sensors that can measure/monitor host-signature or diagnose response to infection, telehealth applications, EHR based tools, algorithms that can predict, identify or prognosticate risk trajectories, clinical decision support software, or continuous monitoring devices. These technologies should be in advanced development and ready for clinical validation. These technologies should be capable of capturing and quantifying a broad range of host biological, immunological, biometric, clinical, laboratory, and/or physiological data. In addition, technologies that incorporate novel informatics approaches to data collection, reporting, and analysis are of interest. Pathogen- targeted and serology diagnostics, as well as bench-top diagnostics, are not of interest for this topic at this time. To be considered relevant under this topic, respondents should have a need to assess clinical validation through conducting a pilot study that meets the following requirements: 1) Total period of performance should have impact for this current COVID-19 outbreak. After clinical validation, technology should have the ability to be rapidly scaled and deployed under an accelerated timeline of less than 90 days. 2) Software tools should be able to be integrated into EHRs or deployed in less than 30 days. 3) Significant preliminary COVID-19 data to support utility of technology for COVID-19. 4) Requires minimal infrastructure or training to deploy and support. 5) Achieved FDA regulatory clearance/approval or have identified a clear regulatory path for deployment, if applicable to technology. 6) Demonstrates a clear commercialization strategy to expand use. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. AOI #4.1-E: Pediatric Diagnostic Tools for Severe COVID-19 Disease and MIS-C The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in children is not fully understood and remains challenging to address. Many children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or display mild symptoms, but the risk of severe COVID-19 disease that may lead to hospitalization and in some cases, sepsis, still exists. More recently, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has been described as a condition where inflammation affects multiple organs causing a range of symptoms that may occur weeks after infection with, or exposure to, SARS- CoV-2. There is a need to develop solutions that recognize or predict severe COVID- 19 disease in children and/or subsequent complications like MIS-C which may arise outside of apparent symptomatic infection. Diagnostic technologies that can specifically identify and distinguish severe COVID- 19 disease from mild illness in children and/or predict the onset of MIS-C are needed to aid in clinical management of these patients. These host-based or clinical technologies may include, but are not limited to: 1) In vitro diagnostics, EHR based tools, or algorithms that can collate data to predict, identify or prognosticate risk trajectories. 2) Clinical decision support software, or remote/continuous monitoring devices appropriately sized for children. Technologies should be capable of capturing and quantifying a broad range of host biological, immunological, clinical, laboratory, and/or physiological data as appropriate to predict and identify severe pediatric COVID-19 and/or MIS-C. Pathogen-based approaches are not of interest at this time nor technologies that cannot distinguish these severe conditions from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. To be considered relevant under this topic, technologies should meet the following minimum requirements: 1) Completed initial studies with pediatric COVID-19 samples with sufficient performance metrics of the technology to identify severe outcomes. 2) Seeking FDA regulatory clearance/approval or EUA if applicable. 3) Have identified clinical study site partners, if needed, for larger scale or prospective studies. 4) Specifically focused on pediatric indication. 5) Focused on product development, not surveillance or epidemiological research. 6) After seeking regulatory approvals, have ability to deploy in multiple US locations within the next 6-12 months in order to have impact during this COVID-19 pandemic. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. AOI #4.2: [CLOSED] AOI #4.3: Alternative Routes of Administration (AROA) for Vaccines Vaccination saves millions of lives per year globally. It is the single most effective public health intervention for preventing infectious diseases. Traditional parenteral vaccinations using needles and syringes are the primary medical intervention for prevention of infections with these viruses. An identified risk during a pandemic response, including SARS-CoV-2, is the availability of needles and syringes used to administer vaccines. One key risk impacting needle and syringe availability in the United States during a pandemic is limited domestic surge manufacturing. In an effort to reduce production costs, the medical supply industry has evolved to “just-in-time” supply chain models over the past two decades. Industry has also moved sourcing and production of raw materials outside the United States. As a result, domestic availability of needle and syringes would be limited during an infectious disease pandemic. Another key risk is the limited number of qualified personnel needed to administer vaccine. Personnel trained in the administration of vaccine include physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical technicians, and pharmacists. In a pandemic where critical care personnel are likely to be in short supply, a successful alternative technology for vaccine administration would reduce the demand qualified personnel to administer vaccine. Enhancing the ease of vaccine administration would logically increase timeliness and vaccine coverage rates, reduce the number of infections, and mitigate mortality and morbidity rates during pandemics compared to current needle and syringe technologies. Alternative technologies for vaccine administration (oral, transdermal (i.e. micro array patches), and aerosol/inhalation), have the potential to eliminate the need for using the currently available needles and syringes during a pandemic response and hopefully self-administration. BARDA is seeking abstracts for the development of alternative routes of administration for vaccines (including oral, transdermal (i.e. micro array patches or aerosol/inhalation)) against CBRN threats, Influenza (seasonal/pandemic), SARS-CoV- 1 / 2, or MERS-CoV. Ideal attributes for vaccines delivered via alternative routes of administration would be single dose, room temperature stable, unadjuvanted and indicated for all populations. Vaccines delivered via alternate routes of administration would have similar or superior performance characteristics as traditional parenterally administered vaccines (i.e. safety and efficacy). Although the technology for alternate routes of administration of vaccines are not expected to adhere to TRLs, it is expected that the respondent obtains and submits an Investigational New Drug (IND) application upon completion of BARDA DRIVe funding for this project or the respondent shall make the vaccine available for potential toxicology and efficacy assessments under separate USG mechanisms. All submissions must include: 1) A vaccine candidate against CBRN threats, Influenza (seasonal/pandemic), SARS- CoV-1 / 2, MERS-CoV, or partnership with an antigen developer to be administered by an alternate route of administration. 2) Plans for IND enabling pre-clinical studies or provide existing data. 3) Product development plan. 4) Any regulatory communication with US FDA (pre-IND/IND). 5) Any pre-clinical or clinical data using this platform. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. AOI #4.4: [CLOSED] B. Eligible Respondents & Scope Parameters: These Special Instructions 010 are open to all responsible sources as described in the EZ-BAA.

Introduction This Easy Broad Agency Announcement (EZ-BAA) sets forth areas of interest (AOIs) for the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) in the Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), issued under paragraph 6.102(d)(2)(i) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Abstract submissions selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with 41 U.S.C. § 3301. A formal Request for Abstract will not be issued. Paper copies of this announcement will also not be issued. The U.S. Government reserves the right to select for award and fund all, some, or none of the abstracts in response to this announcement. The mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st Century health security threats. Within ASPR, BARDA was established to aid in securing our nation from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA supports the transition of medical countermeasures such as vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, and medical devices from research through advanced development towards consideration for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and inclusion into the Strategic National Stockpile. BARDA’s support includes providing funding, technical assistance, and core services. Today we face new health security threats that require breakthrough solutions. To address these new threats, ASPR and BARDA launched DRIVe. DRIVe’s mission is to accelerate innovations, and improve availability of transformative technologies and countermeasures to protect Americans from natural and intentional health security threats. Additional information about DRIVe can be found at www.drive.hhs.gov II. Overview Information A.

Additionally, any individual who has previously provided SETA or A&AS services to BARDA on this specific announcement is ineligible to respond. As part of the submission, all members of the proposed team (including any potential subcontractors/consultants) must certify whether or not their organization (including individual team members and proposed subcontractors/consultants) have provided similar support to any U.S. Government Agency. If a Respondent’s proposed team includes a member who has provided SETA or A&AS support to BARDA or a government agency with whom BARDA engages, it is the responsibility of the Respondent to demonstrate that no conflict of interest exists or would arise. E. Number of Awards Multiple awards of various values are anticipated and dependent upon technical importance to agency programs priorities and funding availability, per the evaluation process described herein. However, the announcement is highly selective and it is anticipated that a small percentage (estimated 5-10%) of those Respondents who submit an abstract will result in award based on market research, programmatic needs, and available funds. The ultimate number of awards is subject to change. F. Type of Award Awards under this EZ-BAA may be a FAR-based firm fixed price contract, cost-sharing contract, other transactional agreement (OTA), or other contract type as deemed appropriate based on the submission. Federal grants will NOT be awarded directly from this announcement. https://sam.gov/SAM/ 6 During negotiations, a decision will be made as to the most appropriate contract type that will be used for a tentative award. Based on the contract type considered, the Respondent may negotiate with either a Contracting Officer (CO), Contract Specialist (CS), or Other Transaction Agreement Officer (OTAO). Respondents shall submit a cost-share proposal in which the Respondent clearly delineates which cost elements (or specific overall percentage) will be accounted for by the Respondent and which of those will be funded by the Government. The amount of cost-share participation should depend on the extent to which the R&D effort or results are likely to enhance the Respondent’s capabilities, expertise, or competitive position. The target Respondent cost-share range is 30-50% of the total project costs (provided by your organization as a cash and/or in-kind contribution expressed in US dollars). The general expectation is that awards resulting from this BAA will have a cost-sharing component. In the rare circumstance that a Respondent does not believe cost-sharing is appropriate, the Respondent may present a written justification demonstrating why there is no probability that the Respondent will receive any present or future benefits from an award made under this EZ-BAA pursuant to the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) 335.070. NOTE: The costs of preparing responses to this EZ-BAA are not considered an allowable direct charge on any resultant award. 7 III. EZ-BAA Process A. Market Engagement DRIVe realizes that the preparation of abstracts often represents a substantial investment of time and effort by a Respondent. While not required, in an attempt to minimize this burden DRIVe encourages organizations and individuals interested in submitting abstracts to schedule a market research call with a DRIVe representative to discuss the technology and the AOI program priorities, to understand if it aligns with the scope of this announcement before expending effort in preparing a detailed abstract or submitting proprietary information. Requests to schedule a call for the applicable AOIs may be sent to the following representatives: 8 AOI #1: ENACT (ENACT@hhs.gov) AOI #2: Solving Sepsis (SolvingSepsis@hhs.gov) AOI #3: Other Disruptive Innovations (Donna.Boston@hhs.gov) B. EZ-BAA DRIVe Portal Instructions All applications in response to the DRIVe EZ-BAA must be submitted on the DRIVe Portal (https://drive.rti.org/) via the process described below and on www.drive.hhs.gov. IMPORTANT: Respondents will be required to apply for a DRIVe Portal account. This account can be requested by visiting the DRIVe Portal site or via the process as described on www.drive.hhs.gov/partner.html and following the applicable prompts. The account request process is simple, but may take up to one week for approval and access. Account requests will require the Respondent to enter a set of basic information about the organization, including its Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code. Upon receipt of a DRIVe Portal account, the Respondent will login using the prescribed two-factor authentication method. Once login is complete, the Respondent will be prompted to confirm the previously entered information about the organization and to input the abstract submission with other project-specific information. Failure to submit the application on-time due to late registration will result in the application not being considered for award. Respondents will be provided automated confirmation of abstract receipt upon successful submission. The abstract must be no more than 12,500 characters (approximately 2,000 words) for the Technical Section and must also include a Rough Order of Magnitude, or ROM, for estimated costs. All abstracts must be submitted electronically via the process described on www.drive.hhs.gov. The following components must be included: C. Abstract Preparation 1. Technical Section: Met the criteria outlined in the identified DRIVe AOI Technical Approach. a. Clearly describe what is being proposed and what difference it would make in the field (qualitatively and quantitatively). b. Include specific tasks, milestones, deliverables, and success metrics that are expected during the course of the project (please limit project to no more than 3-4 main tasks/deliverables). mailto:SolvingSepsis@hhs.gov mailto:Donna.Boston@hhs.gov https://drive.rti.org/ http://www.drive.hhs.gov/ https://drive.rti.org/ http://www.drive.hhs.gov/partner.html 9 c. Describe how the proposed technology is a significant advancement or innovation over the current state of the art (not incremental). d. Describe the preliminary data available to support the proposed technology. e. Describe the ability to transition technology and expand use of application. 2. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Section: In preparing the ROM, please use the EZ-BAA ROM Template located under the Resources tab on the DRIVe website, while providing narrative descriptions of the below cost elements. Please provide the following for each main task/deliverable listed in the Technical Section. 3. Task/Deliverable 1 (please limit project to no more than 3-4 main tasks/deliverables): a. Direct Labor. Briefly describe the employee, position/labor category, level of effort, and functions being performed in the proposed project. b. Materials, Supplies, and Equipment. Briefly describe proposed materials, supplies, and equipment and how it will be used in the proposed project. Provide brief justification of how vendor costs were determined to be reasonable. c. Travel. Briefly describe the purpose of proposed travel, destinations, and number of travelers. Travel may be limited or not authorized based on the final negotiated award type. d. Subcontractors (including Consultants). Please provide narrative description of how the proposed Subcontractors were selected and determined to be reasonable. e. Other Direct Costs (or, ODCs). Include as necessary. f. Total Proposed Cost. Abstracts exceeding $750,000 in proposed Government funding will be considered non-conforming and will not be reviewed. g. Proposed Cost-Share. Clearly indicate and describe the proposed Respondent cost-share, which may consist of cash and/or in-kind contributions. This cost-share may be satisfied by proposing specific line item costs to be provided by the Respondent or may be represented as an overall percentage of proposed total project costs. Regardless, this proposed Respondent cost- share must be quantified. The proposed cost elements should include a breakdown for the entire project value, not just the Government’s portion of the cost-share. As previously mentioned, the $750,000 limitation applies only to the proposed amount of Government funding. It is possible that the total proposed project cost (i.e. Respondent cost-share plus Government funding) exceeds $750,000, so long as the Government funding requested is less than the $750,000 threshold. More detailed cost information may be requested by the CO, the CS, or the OTAO for those selected for further consideration. The period of performance (POP) for awards resulting from the EZ-BAA for all AOIs will be based on the selected contract type and the specific project requirements or stage of development under the award. Establishing the POP gives consideration to the unknown or unexpected results of advanced research and development, industry practices, market conditions, and capabilities of small business concerns. We anticipate the POP for most contracts will be 12-24 months. 10 D. Review Process IMPORTANT: All Respondents will be notified regarding the status of their submission. The target date for notification, or resultant award, is 30-120 days after receipt of abstract. 1. Stage I: Initial Review of Abstracts Abstracts must comply with all requirements detailed in this EZ-BAA. Abstracts that fail to do so will be deemed non-compliant and will not be reviewed. Abstracts which propose technology deemed to be outside the scope of the AOIs defined in this EZ-BAA will be considered non- compliant. Additionally, abstracts which do not propose a cost-share in the 30-50% range (or a justification as to why there is no probability that the Respondent will receive any present or future benefits from an award) may not be considered for award. Compliant abstracts will be reviewed in whole based on the potential enhancement of the overall AOI portfolio by the proposed project. This initial review will result in the Respondent receiving a notice of “Interested” or “Not Interested” based on the potential enhancement to the overall AOI portfolio. Respondents receiving a Not Interested notification will receive a brief rationale for the decision, but formal debriefings will not be provided at this phase under FAR 15.5. Respondents receiving an “Interested” notification will be invited to submit a Statement of Work (SOW), respond to relevant questions, and provide additional supporting cost and technical data as requested. Specific instructions will be provided to Respondents at the time of notification. That information will be evaluated in accordance with criteria outlined in Stage II: Evaluation section below. 2. Stage II: Evaluation Consistent with FAR Part 35.016, submissions will not be evaluated against each other as they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. Each submission is evaluated only against the evaluation criteria defined herein. Submissions received at this phase will be evaluated in whole (i.e. revised initial abstract with additional information requested) and are considered the proposal. Per FAR 35.016, the primary basis for selecting submissions for acceptance shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and fund availability. Accordingly, the Stage II submission will be evaluated pursuant to all of the criteria listed below. The following evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance. Evaluation factors i - iii, when combined, are significantly more important than evaluation factor iv. i. Alignment with relevant AOI strategy ii. Technical Approach iii. Ability to transition technology and expand use of application iv. Cost/Price (including proposed cost-share) v. Past Performance 11 Cost/price reasonableness or cost/price realism will be conducted, as appropriate, based on the award vehicle. Cost-share will be evaluated pursuant to HHSAR 335.070. Past Performance evaluations will be conducted utilizing the Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and other available Government resources. If no relevant past performance is available, a submission will not be negatively or positively impacted and will be rated as “Neutral” for the past performance evaluation factor. The outcome of the Stage II evaluation will result in an overall “Acceptable” or “Not Accepted” rating, as defined in paragraph E below. Respondents who receive a “Not Accepted” rating will be notified and provided a rationale for the decision. Respondents who receive an “Acceptable” rating will be invited to enter into negotiations. Assuming all terms and conditions are mutually agreed upon, negotiations will be deemed successful and an award will be made, subject to the availability of funds. In rare instances, Respondents may receive a rating of “Acceptable, Funding Not Yet Identified.” Notification of this rating does not initiate negotiations, but it notifies the Respondent that its submission satisfies the definition of “Acceptable,” but available program funding has not been identified for the award. This rating does not commit DRIVe to enter into negotiations, but reserves the right for DRIVe to invite the Respondent to enter into negotiations if/when funding is identified. The Respondent may be notified at any time after receiving the notice of this rating that DRIVe will not proceed as the availability of funding for the project becomes clear. Government representatives will be impartial, equitable, and comprehensive when evaluating abstracts. E. Review Definitions 1. Initial Abstract Review Definitions (Stage I): a) Interested: DRIVe is interested in the concept. The project aligns with the relevant AOI program strategy and would likely enhance the overall AOI portfolio by proposing an innovative and realistic technology which fits within the needs of the program. The technology would likely expand the breadth, or significantly enhance or improve, an existing technology in the current AOI portfolio. Potential enhancement to the portfolio also includes technical risk versus reward, in the context of where the technology is in the development process. Abstracts with little or no evidence of supporting data (e.g. proof of concept phase) will receive an “Interested” notification only when the idea and/or project plan are realistic and the potential innovation to the AOI outweighs the risk inherent to technologies in the early phases of development. b) Not Interested: DRIVe is not interested in the concept at this time. The project does not align with the relevant AOI program strategy. The technology would not likely enhance the overall AOI portfolio, is not innovative, or the idea or project plan are not realistic. The technology would 12 not expand the breadth of the current AOI portfolio or would not significantly enhance or improve an existing portfolio technology. 2. Stage II Evaluation Definitions: a) Acceptable: The submission (1) aligns with the AOI strategy, (2) illustrates a clear and feasible technical approach, (3) is likely to result in successful progression of the technology and expanded use in the relative AOI, and (4) includes a cost proposal and past performance that is satisfactory to DRIVe. A finding of Acceptable results in the submission being considered for award, subject to successful negotiations and availability of funding. b) Not Accepted: The submission (1) does not align with the AOI strategy, (2) does not illustrate a clear and feasible technical approach, (3) is unlikely to result in successful progression of the technology or expanded use in the relevant AOI, or (4) does not include a cost proposal or past performance that is satisfactory to DRIVe. A finding of Not Accepted will result in the submission not being considered for award. Respondents whose abstracts are deemed Not Accepted will be provided the weaknesses of their abstract. c) Acceptable, Funding Not Yet Identified: The submission satisfies the definition of “Acceptable” as defined above, however, available program funding has not been identified for award. This rating does not commit DRIVe to enter negotiations, but reserves DRIVe’s right to invite the Respondent to enter into negotiations if/when funding is identified. The Respondent may be notified at any time after receiving the notice of this rating that DRIVe will not proceed as the availability of funding for the project becomes clearer. F. Abstract Handling and Submission Information 1. DRIVe Safeguarding of Information: DRIVe takes the protection of Respondent information very seriously to ensure that such information is safeguarded in full compliance with all applicable regulation and law. All information on abstracts, except where clearly marked in the application as non-proprietary, will be treated as the Respondent’s proprietary information. By engaging in a market research call, submitting information related to this announcement, or entering into a contract resulting from this announcement, Respondents acknowledge that non- federal BARDA personnel may participate in the process and provide input compliant with FAR 37.203(d). Non-federal BARDA personnel may also handle submissions for administrative purposes and for collection/analysis of non-proprietary submission information (e.g. business size) as denoted on the submission form. All non-federal BARDA personnel who support DRIVe are strictly bound by the appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Respondents should not engage in any part of the announcement process if they do not consent to the participation of non-federal consultants as described in this subparagraph. 2. Classified Information: Classified abstracts, in part or in whole, will not be accepted. All submissions must be Unclassified. 13 3. Post-Employment Conflict of Interest: There are certain post-employment restrictions on former federal officers and employees, including special Government employees (Section 207 of Title 18, U.S.C.). The appropriate Government personnel will discuss any conflict of interest with the Respondent. 4. Unsuccessful Abstract Disposition: The e-filling copy of each abstract received will be retained by DRIVe pursuant to FAR 4.805. IV.

This is to ensure a review and response to all inquiries submitted in regard to this EZ-BAA. V. Limitation on Communication after Submission Be advised that while you are encouraged to contact DRIVe program representatives before submitting an abstract, the opposite is true after an EZ-BAA abstract has been submitted. At that point, all communication related to that submission must be through DRIVeContracting@hhs.gov, which is closely tracked and monitored. All communications in response to a submission will be from the CO, CS, or OTAO as required. VI. Areas of Interest (AOI) DRIVe is seeking abstracts for technologies and innovations to increase our capability and capacity to respond to national security health threats, with an emphasis on the AOIs described herein. DRIVe anticipates that awards made as a result of this EZ-BAA may occur at any stage of development. This EZ-BAA will also serve to advance the knowledge and scientific understanding of platform technologies, inventions, modeling, forecasting, and visual analytics. DRIVe wants to emphasize revolutionary approaches that are hyper-focused on the AOIs described herein. DRIVe seeks novel approaches that may not have been applied to the field previously, which could include approaches that are outside the mainstream, and could help mailto:Francine.Hemphill@hhs.gov mailto:DRIVeContracting@hhs.gov mailto:DRIVeContracting@hhs.gov 14 populate the health security innovations development pipeline. For additional information please visit: • The DRIVe website: www.DRIVe.hhs.gov • Section 301 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 241), “Research and Investigations.” • Section 319L of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-7e), “Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.” DRIVe reserves the right to add, remove, or refine any AOI description in this announcement that falls within BARDA’s mission space, as deemed appropriate. Descriptions of Areas of Interest A. AOI #1: Early Notification to Act, Control and Treat (ENACT) Through ENACT, DRIVe is seeking technologies and methods to identify, characterize, and broadly adapt biological, biometric, behavioral and physiological signatures that can signal health security threat infections or exposures prior to symptoms. ENACT areas of interest include discovery and validation of biomarkers and other health signatures, diagnostics suitable for use in the home or on the body, novel sensing and other wearable technologies coupled with cloud-based reporting and data analytics, and disease prognostication to empower individuals with early notification to act, control, and treat illnesses. In the event of a public health emergency, the ability to detect, triage, and prognosticate outcomes is critical to saving lives and providing help to those in need. Current focus areas include: • Host-based quantitative diagnostics, sensors, and/or technologies that can be deployed and used by a lay person in the home to monitor and measure innate and adaptive immunity that can predict illness at minimum 12 hours prior to symptoms. Wearable technologies that can be continuous or as near to continuous as possible that are non-invasive or minimally invasive (finger prick). Special weighting will be placed on technologies that sample in novel ways (saliva, interstitial, sweat, etc.). • The ENACT team has available retrospective and prospective wearable data including heart rate, heart rate variability, accelerometer, electrocardiogram, and other health signature data sets that can be made available for data analytics, algorithm development, and data mining. The program will support any development and validation of models from prospective partners and can make data available including de-identified clinical data sets including polymerase chain reaction positive data for model development. The following areas that are considered out of scope at this time: http://www.drive.hhs.gov/ 15 • Pathogen based detection or technologies – any technologies that are based on the identification of pathogens will not be considered responsive at this time. • Any technology that is not minimally invasive – any technology that requires sample preparation and cannot be used by a lay person, as considered by the FDA, will not be considered responsive at this time. NOTE: All awarded ENACT partners will be required to share de-identified data in effort to advance the field and knowledge. Interested partners are encouraged to commercialize their technology and algorithms but data collected through the use of Government funding will be made available through full Government purpose rights. B. AOI #2: Solving Sepsis At least 1.7 million Americans develop sepsis each year and nearly 270,000 Americans die1 annually as a result. Sepsis occurs when an infection leads to a dysregulated host response and organ dysfunction. In addition to the toll on health, sepsis incurs a large economic burden and sepsis survivors also sustain additional chronic illnesses and associated care expenses. A complication of any health security threat is sepsis, which has a very high potential to arise consequent to any of these threats. In order to fully protect Americans and save lives, the DRIVe Solving Sepsis program aims to reduce the incidence, morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of sepsis by investing in key strategic areas. The program is catalyzing technological approaches along the sepsis patient continuum to empower both the patient and the healthcare provider with a focus on innovative technologies that specifically address sepsis. Current focus areas are limited to: • Diagnostics that predict, identify or prognosticate outcomes of sepsis in pre-hospital settings. It is important that these diagnostics are able to distinguish sepsis from infection alone or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome alone. • Technologies that improve early detection, diagnosis and/or clinical management of neonatal and/or pediatric sepsis patients. • Post-sepsis monitoring technologies (after hospital discharge) to detect health deterioration and to inform on clinical care. These technologies should be appropriate for community settings (e.g. nursing homes, home, etc.). • Innovative host sepsis therapies including patient stratification (e.g. endotyping) approaches to better inform on clinical management strategies to improve patient outcomes. Submissions should be responsive to the following: • Medical countermeasures that address sepsis of any etiology (i.e. bacterial, viral, other) versus approaches that are limited to sepsis induced by a subset of pathogens. • Clinical or patient adoption strategies in relevant settings for use and implementation of the 1 https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/index.html 16 proposed technology. • Prior demonstration and preliminary data to support use in sepsis relevant models (e.g. sepsis patient samples, sepsis patient clinical data). • Technologies should focus on host-based approaches. BARDA has existing programs for pathogen-targeted approaches outside of the Solving Sepsis program. • Research should be considered translational science. There is no interest in fundamental research projects at this time. • A clear FDA regulatory path for approval/clearance (if appropriate) and if available, evidence of engagement with regulatory authorities. • Consideration of commercialization strategy outside the work proposed to this announcement. This may include other ongoing relevant research, establishment of partnerships with appropriate device fabricators/manufacturers, addressing the ability to scale and intellectual property. In addition, the cost/unit, reimbursement strategy, etc. should be addressed. The following are considered out of scope at this time: • Pathogen-based approaches. • Device or technologies that address prevention or detection of infection only. • Supportive care technologies that don’t specifically improve clinical outcomes for sepsis patients. • Sepsis diagnostics that are limited to the intensive care unit hospital setting only. • Exploratory research with no near term translational application. C. AOI #3: Other Disruptive Innovations (ODI) The ODI program seeks products and solutions that will radically transform health security. DRIVe is looking for extremely bold and disruptive innovative solutions in line with its mission to produce easy-to-use, safe and effective medical countermeasures (MCMs) and devices. These ideas could not only lead to revolutionary products and technologies in health security- related patient care but also lend themselves to more novel approaches to develop, procure and deploy/distribute MCMs in a public health emergency. DRIVe has identified the following areas in which performers could propose their disruptive and innovative solutions: • Vaccine and Drug Administration: Increase compliance and improve outcomes. Examples might include technologies that lead to alternative routes of administration; needle-less, micro- needle and other types of drug delivery platforms. The goal is to improve efficacy and reduce the logistical burden of ancillary equipment, adjuvants and multiple-dose regimens that is associated with the current mode of vaccine and drug administration. • Clinical Diagnostics: Empower individuals and clinicians with early, actionable information. Examples include the application of technologies such as next generation diagnostics to revolutionize laboratory or near-patient testing to provide faster results for capturing and predicting health events so that timely responses and medical interventions can be deployed. • Development and Manufacturing: Enable rapid drug development, and distributed or decentralized manufacturing. For example, vaccines and/or medical countermeasures that can be 17 produced and delivered on-demand in a distributed fashion by technologies such as 3-D printing and other advances that adopt modular approaches to vaccine production. • Therapeutics: Develop universal therapeutics with broad-spectrum efficacy. For example new host-based drug targets, immunomodulators and microbiome-based therapeutics that can lead to new treatment opportunities for infectious diseases that threaten our national health security. The examples provided above are pointers to some novel ideas and are by no means exhaustive. Performers are encouraged to submit innovative technologies which may not fit into the above categories but have the ability to impact health security in threat areas that are highly relevant to BARDA, namely chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear as well as in the areas of pandemic and emerging infectious disease threats. VII. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables Some reports and other deliverables are relevant to specific activities performed during the period of performance under the contract, grant, or agreement. The Respondent and the Government will agree during final negotiations which reports and other deliverables are relevant and will be required as deliverables as determined in the negotiated final SOW. Reports required will be prepared and delivered throughout performance, and should be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Adobe Acrobat PDF, and/or data-fields to a Government identified system. A. Reports 1. Technical Progress Reports: The frequency of Technical Progress Reporting will be determined by the Government during negotiations. Typically, on the 20th day of each month, the Respondent must submit a Technical Progress Report describing activities performed during the previous calendar month. The appropriate formats for the Technical Progress Report will be provided by the Government. The Technical Progress Reports may include project timelines and summaries of product manufacturing, testing, and clinical evaluation activities as applicable. A Technical Progress Report will not be required for the month in which the Final Report is due. 2. Final Report: By the expiration date of selected procurement instrument, the Respondent will submit a Final Report that details, documents, and summarizes the results of all work performed under the contract. B. Meetings The Respondent will participate in regular meetings to coordinate and oversee the contract effort as directed by the CO, CS, OTAO, and Contracting Officer Representative (COR), Other Transaction Agreement Technical Representative and other Government technical representatives as required. Such meetings may include, but are not limited to, all Respondent and subcontractors to discuss technical progress, transition activities, schedule, cost, regulatory issues, or other relevant activities. 18 Recurring teleconferences between the Respondent and subcontractors and the Government may be held to review technical progress. The Government reserves the right to request more frequent teleconferences and face-to-face meetings depending on the nature and importance of the work being performed. The Respondent will receive feedback from the Government during the teleconference regarding contract performance. The Respondent will have an opportunity to respond and recommend corrective actions. The only contractual relationship will be between the Government and the prime Respondent. C. Program Management Plans and Documentation 1. Product Development Plan (PDP): Within one month of the effective date of an award, the successful Respondent may be required to submit a PDP, which will be approved by the CO, or OTAO prior to initiation of any activities related to their implementation. Part of the Project plan should include a Gantt chart and an identified risks and mitigation table. 2. Commercialization Plan: As requested. VIII. Intermittent Pausing of New Abstract Submissions Acceptance of abstracts submitted under this EZ-BAA may temporarily be placed on hold as a result of a lack of available of funding. Notices of these intermissions, if necessary, will be communicated via modification to the EZ-BAA posted on www.beta.sam.gov. IX. Special Instructions to the EZ-BAA Special instructions may be required and will be advertised via the EZ-BAA announcement on www.beta.sam.gov. Any Special Instructions announcement issued would describe a specific research interest and could address any topic within the BARDA mission space. Special Instructions announcements may require instructions tailored to the specific needs of Government requirements, but no resulting award shall exceed the size and scope of awards defined above. X. Additional Information A. Inspection of Facilities Respondents selected for negotiations may be subject to inspections of their facilities and Quality Assurance/Quality Control capabilities. Regulatory and Quality Management; FDA submissions and meetings; and Audits/Site Visits, as applicable, will be discussed during negotiations. The decision to inspect specific facilities will be made by the CO or OTAO in coordination with the COR, OTR, or other Government technical representative as required. If inspections are performed during the negotiations, the results of the inspection will be considered in final http://www.beta.sam.gov/ http://www.beta.sam.gov/ 19 selection for award of a contract, grant or agreement. B. Inspection of Records Respondents, including proposed subcontractors, will be requested to make all non-proprietary records, including previous regulatory inspection records, and staff available in response to a pre- award site visit or audit by a Government representative. Pre-award site visits may be made with short notice. Respondents are expected to guarantee the availability of key staff or other staff determined by the Government as essential for purposes of this site visit. C. Provisions and Contract Clauses Awards received through this announcement are not controlled by general procedures of FAR Part 15 “Contracting by Negotiation,” rather they are awarded under the authority and procedures described in FAR Part 35 “Research and Development Contracting.” Accordingly, given the inherent nature of a broad agency announcement, specific terms, conditions, and contract clauses can only be determined by specifics of a proposed project and will be determined based on the appropriate contract and entity type. Accordingly, contract clauses will be identified and defined during negotiations prior to award. Respondents are advised to review, in advance, those provisions and clauses which would be relevant to the work contemplated by the Respondent to ensure compliance with all terms and conditions will be satisfied. Unless otherwise authorized, the FAR as well as the HHS Acquisition Regulations (HHSAR) will be applicable to any award executed under this announcement. I. Introduction II. Overview Information A.

Introduction This Easy Broad Agency Announcement (EZ-BAA) sets forth areas of interest (AOIs) for the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) in the Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), issued under paragraph 6.102(d)(2)(i) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Abstract submissions selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with 41 U.S.C. § 3301. A formal Request for Abstract will not be issued. Paper copies of this announcement will also not be issued. The U.S. Government reserves the right to select for award and fund all, some, or none of the abstracts in response to this announcement. The mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st Century health security threats. Within ASPR, BARDA was established to aid in securing our nation from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA supports the transition of medical countermeasures such as vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, and medical devices from research through advanced development towards consideration for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and inclusion into the Strategic National Stockpile. BARDA’s support includes providing funding, technical assistance, and core services. Today we face new health security threats that require breakthrough solutions. To address these new threats, ASPR and BARDA launched DRIVe. DRIVe’s mission is to accelerate innovations, and improve availability of transformative technologies and countermeasures to protect Americans from natural and intentional health security threats. Additional information about DRIVe can be found at www.drive.hhs.gov II. Overview Information A. Agency and Issuing Office U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Secretary (OS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) 200 C Street SW, Washington, DC, 20201 B. Objective This EZ-BAA aims to accelerate innovations and improve the availability of transformative products and technologies to protect Americans from natural and intentional health security http://www.drive.hhs.gov/ 4 threats. DRIVe is seeking abstracts for efforts to develop revolutionary health security products, technologies, and innovations in order to increase the Government’s capability and capacity to respond to national security health threats. DRIVe is seeking transformative and innovative approaches that are outside of the mainstream, challenge assumptions, require multi-disciplinary teaming, and have the potential to radically change established practices, lead to extraordinary outcomes, and create entirely new fields. The projects awarded under this EZ-BAA may be at varying stages of technological readiness and development. DRIVe is interested in projects that span the entire product development spectrum (but may vary within each AOI). Responses should be focused on the AOIs in this EZ-BAA. Respondents may propose a variety of research and development (R&D) projects relevant to the AOIs, including early research R&D, non-clinical development, process development, formulation, engineering, fabrication, model development, data science and development of novel algorithms, descriptive clinical studies, regulatory activities, etc. The AOI sections of this announcement provide more details. The total Government share of funding, including options, of any project awarded under this EZ- BAA shall be less than $750,000. Abstracts exceeding this amount will be considered non- responsive and will not be further reviewed. DRIVe anticipates a high-volume of abstract submissions, with only a small number of awards. C. Announcement Type and Date Type: Broad Agency Announcement Date: 03 February 2020 Title: DRIVe EZ-BAA Announcement Number: BAA-20-100-SOL-0002 Applications may be continuously submitted electronically via www.drive.hhs.gov until 03 February 2023 at 1700 HRS ET. Abstract submissions will not be accepted after this date, although DRIVe reserves the right to extend this period, as necessary. D. Eligible Respondents This EZ-BAA is open to all responsible sources. Respondents may include single entities or teams from private sector organizations, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions. To be eligible for award, the Respondent must be able to demonstrate its ability to achieve the stated goals and objectives in the submitted abstract, as well as the ability and capacity to perform. More specifically, the Respondent must have at a minimum the financial resources, ability to comply with the performance schedule, satisfactory performance, integrity, organization, experience, operational controls, technical controls, technical skills, facilities, and http://www.drive.hhs.gov/ 5 equipment as required for performance. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business concerns, Women-Owned Small Business concerns, Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, and HUB Zone Small Business concerns are encouraged to submit abstracts and to join other entities as team members in submitting abstracts. In accordance with federal statutes, regulations, and HHS policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the HHS. Respondents must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) with the appropriate North American Industry Classification System code prior to proposal submission. Registration can be completed here: https://sam.gov/SAM/ Without prior approval, non-federal BARDA personnel cannot simultaneously provide scientific, engineering, technical assistance (SETA), advisory and assistance services (A&AS), or similar support, to any part of the U.S. Government and also be eligible to participate as a Respondent under this announcement. Any individual who has previously provided SETA or A&AS services to ASPR within one year is ineligible to respond. Additionally, any individual who has previously provided SETA or A&AS services to BARDA on this specific announcement is ineligible to respond. As part of the submission, all members of the proposed team (including any potential subcontractors/consultants) must certify whether or not their organization (including individual team members and proposed subcontractors/consultants) have provided similar support to any U.S. Government Agency. If a Respondent’s proposed team includes a member who has provided SETA or A&AS support to BARDA or a government agency with whom BARDA engages, it is the responsibility of the Respondent to demonstrate that no conflict of interest exists or would arise. E. Number of Awards Multiple awards of various values are anticipated and dependent upon technical importance to agency programs priorities and funding availability, per the evaluation process described herein. However, the announcement is highly selective and it is anticipated that a small percentage (estimated 5-10%) of those Respondents who submit an abstract will result in award based on market research, programmatic needs, and available funds. The ultimate number of awards is subject to change. F. Type of Award Awards under this EZ-BAA may be a FAR-based firm fixed price contract, cost-sharing contract, other transactional agreement (OTA), or other contract type as deemed appropriate based on the submission. Federal grants will NOT be awarded directly from this announcement. https://sam.gov/SAM/ 6 During negotiations, a decision will be made as to the most appropriate contract type that will be used for a tentative award. Based on the contract type considered, the Respondent may negotiate with either a Contracting Officer (CO), Contract Specialist (CS), or Other Transaction Agreement Officer (OTAO). Respondents shall submit a cost-share proposal in which the Respondent clearly delineates which cost elements (or specific overall percentage) will be accounted for by the Respondent and which of those will be funded by the Government. The amount of cost-share participation should depend on the extent to which the R&D effort or results are likely to enhance the Respondent’s capabilities, expertise, or competitive position. The target Respondent cost-share range is 30-50% of the total project costs (provided by your organization as a cash and/or in-kind contribution expressed in US dollars). The general expectation is that awards resulting from this BAA will have a cost-sharing component. In the rare circumstance that a Respondent does not believe cost-sharing is appropriate, the Respondent may present a written justification demonstrating why there is no probability that the Respondent will receive any present or future benefits from an award made under this EZ-BAA pursuant to the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) 335.070. NOTE: The costs of preparing responses to this EZ-BAA are not considered an allowable direct charge on any resultant award. 7 III. EZ-BAA Process A. Market Engagement DRIVe realizes that the preparation of abstracts often represents a substantial investment of time and effort by a Respondent. While not required, in an attempt to minimize this burden DRIVe encourages organizations and individuals interested in submitting abstracts to schedule a market research call with a DRIVe representative to discuss the technology and the AOI program priorities, to understand if it aligns with the scope of this announcement before expending effort in preparing a detailed abstract or submitting proprietary information. Requests to schedule a call for the applicable AOIs may be sent to the following representatives: 8 AOI #1: ENACT (ENACT@hhs.gov) AOI #2: Solving Sepsis (SolvingSepsis@hhs.gov) AOI #3: Other Disruptive Innovations (Donna.Boston@hhs.gov) B. EZ-BAA DRIVe Portal Instructions All applications in response to the DRIVe EZ-BAA must be submitted on the DRIVe Portal (https://drive.rti.org/) via the process described below and on www.drive.hhs.gov. IMPORTANT: Respondents will be required to apply for a DRIVe Portal account. This account can be requested by visiting the DRIVe Portal site or via the process as described on www.drive.hhs.gov/partner.html and following the applicable prompts. The account request process is simple, but may take up to one week for approval and access. Account requests will require the Respondent to enter a set of basic information about the organization, including its Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code. Upon receipt of a DRIVe Portal account, the Respondent will login using the prescribed two-factor authentication method. Once login is complete, the Respondent will be prompted to confirm the previously entered information about the organization and to input the abstract submission with other project-specific information. Failure to submit the application on-time due to late registration will result in the application not being considered for award. Respondents will be provided automated confirmation of abstract receipt upon successful submission. The abstract must be no more than 12,500 characters (approximately 2,000 words) for the Technical Section and must also include a Rough Order of Magnitude, or ROM, for estimated costs. All abstracts must be submitted electronically via the process described on www.drive.hhs.gov. The following components must be included: C. Abstract Preparation 1. Technical Section: Met the criteria outlined in the identified DRIVe AOI Technical Approach. a. Clearly describe what is being proposed and what difference it would make in the field (qualitatively and quantitatively). b. Include specific tasks, milestones, deliverables, and success metrics that are expected during the course of the project (please limit project to no more than 3-4 main tasks/deliverables). mailto:SolvingSepsis@hhs.gov mailto:Donna.Boston@hhs.gov https://drive.rti.org/ http://www.drive.hhs.gov/ https://drive.rti.org/ http://www.drive.hhs.gov/partner.html 9 c. Describe how the proposed technology is a significant advancement or innovation over the current state of the art (not incremental). d. Describe the preliminary data available to support the proposed technology. e. Describe the ability to transition technology and expand use of application. 2. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Section: In preparing the ROM, please use the EZ-BAA ROM Template located under the Resources tab on the DRIVe website, while providing narrative descriptions of the below cost elements. Please provide the following for each main task/deliverable listed in the Technical Section. 3. Task/Deliverable 1 (please limit project to no more than 3-4 main tasks/deliverables): a. Direct Labor. Briefly describe the employee, position/labor category, level of effort, and functions being performed in the proposed project. b. Materials, Supplies, and Equipment. Briefly describe proposed materials, supplies, and equipment and how it will be used in the proposed project. Provide brief justification of how vendor costs were determined to be reasonable. c. Travel. Briefly describe the purpose of proposed travel, destinations, and number of travelers. Travel may be limited or not authorized based on the final negotiated award type. d. Subcontractors (including Consultants). Please provide narrative description of how the proposed Subcontractors were selected and determined to be reasonable. e. Other Direct Costs (or, ODCs). Include as necessary. f. Total Proposed Cost. Abstracts exceeding $750,000 in proposed Government funding will be considered non-conforming and will not be reviewed. g. Proposed Cost-Share. Clearly indicate and describe the proposed Respondent cost-share, which may consist of cash and/or in-kind contributions. This cost-share may be satisfied by proposing specific line item costs to be provided by the Respondent or may be represented as an overall percentage of proposed total project costs. Regardless, this proposed Respondent cost- share must be quantified. The proposed cost elements should include a breakdown for the entire project value, not just the Government’s portion of the cost-share. As previously mentioned, the $750,000 limitation applies only to the proposed amount of Government funding. It is possible that the total proposed project cost (i.e. Respondent cost-share plus Government funding) exceeds $750,000, so long as the Government funding requested is less than the $750,000 threshold. More detailed cost information may be requested by the CO, the CS, or the OTAO for those selected for further consideration. The period of performance (POP) for awards resulting from the EZ-BAA for all AOIs will be based on the selected contract type and the specific project requirements or stage of development under the award. Establishing the POP gives consideration to the unknown or unexpected results of advanced research and development, industry practices, market conditions, and capabilities of small business concerns. We anticipate the POP for most contracts will be 12-24 months. 10 D. Review Process IMPORTANT: All Respondents will be notified regarding the status of their submission. The target date for notification, or resultant award, is 30-120 days after receipt of abstract. 1. Stage I: Initial Review of Abstracts Abstracts must comply with all requirements detailed in this EZ-BAA. Abstracts that fail to do so will be deemed non-compliant and will not be reviewed. Abstracts which propose technology deemed to be outside the scope of the AOIs defined in this EZ-BAA will be considered non- compliant. Additionally, abstracts which do not propose a cost-share in the 30-50% range (or a justification as to why there is no probability that the Respondent will receive any present or future benefits from an award) may not be considered for award. Compliant abstracts will be reviewed in whole based on the potential enhancement of the overall AOI portfolio by the proposed project. This initial review will result in the Respondent receiving a notice of “Interested” or “Not Interested” based on the potential enhancement to the overall AOI portfolio. Respondents receiving a Not Interested notification will receive a brief rationale for the decision, but formal debriefings will not be provided at this phase under FAR 15.5. Respondents receiving an “Interested” notification will be invited to submit a Statement of Work (SOW), respond to relevant questions, and provide additional supporting cost and technical data as requested. Specific instructions will be provided to Respondents at the time of notification. That information will be evaluated in accordance with criteria outlined in Stage II: Evaluation section below. 2. Stage II: Evaluation Consistent with FAR Part 35.016, submissions will not be evaluated against each other as they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. Each submission is evaluated only against the evaluation criteria defined herein. Submissions received at this phase will be evaluated in whole (i.e. revised initial abstract with additional information requested) and are considered the proposal. Per FAR 35.016, the primary basis for selecting submissions for acceptance shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and fund availability. Accordingly, the Stage II submission will be evaluated pursuant to all of the criteria listed below. The following evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance. Evaluation factors i - iii, when combined, are significantly more important than evaluation factor iv. i. Alignment with relevant AOI strategy ii. Technical Approach iii. Ability to transition technology and expand use of application iv. Cost/Price (including proposed cost-share) v. Past Performance 11 Cost/price reasonableness or cost/price realism will be conducted, as appropriate, based on the award vehicle. Cost-share will be evaluated pursuant to HHSAR 335.070. Past Performance evaluations will be conducted utilizing the Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and other available Government resources. If no relevant past performance is available, a submission will not be negatively or positively impacted and will be rated as “Neutral” for the past performance evaluation factor. The outcome of the Stage II evaluation will result in an overall “Acceptable” or “Not Accepted” rating, as defined in paragraph E below. Respondents who receive a “Not Accepted” rating will be notified and provided a rationale for the decision. Respondents who receive an “Acceptable” rating will be invited to enter into negotiations. Assuming all terms and conditions are mutually agreed upon, negotiations will be deemed successful and an award will be made, subject to the availability of funds. In rare instances, Respondents may receive a rating of “Acceptable, Funding Not Yet Identified.” Notification of this rating does not initiate negotiations, but it notifies the Respondent that its submission satisfies the definition of “Acceptable,” but available program funding has not been identified for the award. This rating does not commit DRIVe to enter into negotiations, but reserves the right for DRIVe to invite the Respondent to enter into negotiations if/when funding is identified. The Respondent may be notified at any time after receiving the notice of this rating that DRIVe will not proceed as the availability of funding for the project becomes clear. Government representatives will be impartial, equitable, and comprehensive when evaluating abstracts. E. Review Definitions 1. Initial Abstract Review Definitions (Stage I): a) Interested: DRIVe is interested in the concept. The project aligns with the relevant AOI program strategy and would likely enhance the overall AOI portfolio by proposing an innovative and realistic technology which fits within the needs of the program. The technology would likely expand the breadth, or significantly enhance or improve, an existing technology in the current AOI portfolio. Potential enhancement to the portfolio also includes technical risk versus reward, in the context of where the technology is in the development process. Abstracts with little or no evidence of supporting data (e.g. proof of concept phase) will receive an “Interested” notification only when the idea and/or project plan are realistic and the potential innovation to the AOI outweighs the risk inherent to technologies in the early phases of development. b) Not Interested: DRIVe is not interested in the concept at this time. The project does not align with the relevant AOI program strategy. The technology would not likely enhance the overall AOI portfolio, is not innovative, or the idea or project plan are not realistic. The technology would 12 not expand the breadth of the current AOI portfolio or would not significantly enhance or improve an existing portfolio technology. 2. Stage II Evaluation Definitions: a) Acceptable: The submission (1) aligns with the AOI strategy, (2) illustrates a clear and feasible technical approach, (3) is likely to result in successful progression of the technology and expanded use in the relative AOI, and (4) includes a cost proposal and past performance that is satisfactory to DRIVe. A finding of Acceptable results in the submission being considered for award, subject to successful negotiations and availability of funding. b) Not Accepted: The submission (1) does not align with the AOI strategy, (2) does not illustrate a clear and feasible technical approach, (3) is unlikely to result in successful progression of the technology or expanded use in the relevant AOI, or (4) does not include a cost proposal or past performance that is satisfactory to DRIVe. A finding of Not Accepted will result in the submission not being considered for award. Respondents whose abstracts are deemed Not Accepted will be provided the weaknesses of their abstract. c) Acceptable, Funding Not Yet Identified: The submission satisfies the definition of “Acceptable” as defined above, however, available program funding has not been identified for award. This rating does not commit DRIVe to enter negotiations, but reserves DRIVe’s right to invite the Respondent to enter into negotiations if/when funding is identified. The Respondent may be notified at any time after receiving the notice of this rating that DRIVe will not proceed as the availability of funding for the project becomes clearer. F. Abstract Handling and Submission Information 1. DRIVe Safeguarding of Information: DRIVe takes the protection of Respondent information very seriously to ensure that such information is safeguarded in full compliance with all applicable regulation and law. All information on abstracts, except where clearly marked in the application as non-proprietary, will be treated as the Respondent’s proprietary information. By engaging in a market research call, submitting information related to this announcement, or entering into a contract resulting from this announcement, Respondents acknowledge that non- federal BARDA personnel may participate in the process and provide input compliant with FAR 37.203(d).

All communications in response to a submission will be from the CO, CS, or OTAO as required. VI. Areas of Interest (AOI) DRIVe is seeking abstracts for technologies and innovations to increase our capability and capacity to respond to national security health threats, with an emphasis on the AOIs described herein. DRIVe anticipates that awards made as a result of this EZ-BAA may occur at any stage of development. This EZ-BAA will also serve to advance the knowledge and scientific understanding of platform technologies, inventions, modeling, forecasting, and visual analytics. DRIVe wants to emphasize revolutionary approaches that are hyper-focused on the AOIs described herein. DRIVe seeks novel approaches that may not have been applied to the field previously, which could include approaches that are outside the mainstream, and could help mailto:Francine.Hemphill@hhs.gov mailto:DRIVeContracting@hhs.gov mailto:DRIVeContracting@hhs.gov 14 populate the health security innovations development pipeline. For additional information please visit: • The DRIVe website: www.DRIVe.hhs.gov • Section 301 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 241), “Research and Investigations.” • Section 319L of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-7e), “Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.” DRIVe reserves the right to add, remove, or refine any AOI description in this announcement that falls within BARDA’s mission space, as deemed appropriate. Descriptions of Areas of Interest A. AOI #1: Early Notification to Act, Control and Treat (ENACT) Through ENACT, DRIVe is seeking technologies and methods to identify, characterize, and broadly adapt biological, biometric, behavioral and physiological signatures that can signal health security threat infections or exposures prior to symptoms. ENACT areas of interest include discovery and validation of biomarkers and other health signatures, diagnostics suitable for use in the home or on the body, novel sensing and other wearable technologies coupled with cloud-based reporting and data analytics, and disease prognostication to empower individuals with early notification to act, control, and treat illnesses. In the event of a public health emergency, the ability to detect, triage, and prognosticate outcomes is critical to saving lives and providing help to those in need. Current focus areas include: • Host-based quantitative diagnostics, sensors, and/or technologies that can be deployed and used by a lay person in the home to monitor and measure innate and adaptive immunity that can predict illness at minimum 12 hours prior to symptoms. Wearable technologies that can be continuous or as near to continuous as possible that are non-invasive or minimally invasive (finger prick). Special weighting will be placed on technologies that sample in novel ways (saliva, interstitial, sweat, etc.). • The ENACT team has available retrospective and prospective wearable data including heart rate, heart rate variability, accelerometer, electrocardiogram, and other health signature data sets that can be made available for data analytics, algorithm development, and data mining. The program will support any development and validation of models from prospective partners and can make data available including de-identified clinical data sets including polymerase chain reaction positive data for model development. The following areas that are considered out of scope at this time: http://www.drive.hhs.gov/ 15 • Pathogen based detection or technologies – any technologies that are based on the identification of pathogens will not be considered responsive at this time. • Any technology that is not minimally invasive – any technology that requires sample preparation and cannot be used by a lay person, as considered by the FDA, will not be considered responsive at this time. NOTE: All awarded ENACT partners will be required to share de-identified data in effort to advance the field and knowledge. Interested partners are encouraged to commercialize their technology and algorithms but data collected through the use of Government funding will be made available through full Government purpose rights. B. AOI #2: Solving Sepsis At least 1.7 million Americans develop sepsis each year and nearly 270,000 Americans die1 annually as a result. Sepsis occurs when an infection leads to a dysregulated host response and organ dysfunction. In addition to the toll on health, sepsis incurs a large economic burden and sepsis survivors also sustain additional chronic illnesses and associated care expenses. A complication of any health security threat is sepsis, which has a very high potential to arise consequent to any of these threats. In order to fully protect Americans and save lives, the DRIVe Solving Sepsis program aims to reduce the incidence, morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of sepsis by investing in key strategic areas. The program is catalyzing technological approaches along the sepsis patient continuum to empower both the patient and the healthcare provider with a focus on innovative technologies that specifically address sepsis. Current focus areas are limited to: • Diagnostics that predict, identify or prognosticate outcomes of sepsis in pre-hospital settings. It is important that these diagnostics are able to distinguish sepsis from infection alone or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome alone. • Technologies that improve early detection, diagnosis and/or clinical management of neonatal and/or pediatric sepsis patients. • Post-sepsis monitoring technologies (after hospital discharge) to detect health deterioration and to inform on clinical care. These technologies should be appropriate for community settings (e.g. nursing homes, home, etc.). • Innovative host sepsis therapies including patient stratification (e.g. endotyping) approaches to better inform on clinical management strategies to improve patient outcomes. Submissions should be responsive to the following: • Medical countermeasures that address sepsis of any etiology (i.e. bacterial, viral, other) versus approaches that are limited to sepsis induced by a subset of pathogens. • Clinical or patient adoption strategies in relevant settings for use and implementation of the 1 https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/index.html 16 proposed technology. • Prior demonstration and preliminary data to support use in sepsis relevant models (e.g. sepsis patient samples, sepsis patient clinical data). • Technologies should focus on host-based approaches. BARDA has existing programs for pathogen-targeted approaches outside of the Solving Sepsis program. • Research should be considered translational science. There is no interest in fundamental research projects at this time. • A clear FDA regulatory path for approval/clearance (if appropriate) and if available, evidence of engagement with regulatory authorities. • Consideration of commercialization strategy outside the work proposed to this announcement. This may include other ongoing relevant research, establishment of partnerships with appropriate device fabricators/manufacturers, addressing the ability to scale and intellectual property. In addition, the cost/unit, reimbursement strategy, etc. should be addressed. The following are considered out of scope at this time: • Pathogen-based approaches. • Device or technologies that address prevention or detection of infection only. • Supportive care technologies that don’t specifically improve clinical outcomes for sepsis patients. • Sepsis diagnostics that are limited to the intensive care unit hospital setting only. • Exploratory research with no near term translational application. C. AOI #3: Other Disruptive Innovations (ODI) The ODI program seeks products and solutions that will radically transform health security. DRIVe is looking for extremely bold and disruptive innovative solutions in line with its mission to produce easy-to-use, safe and effective medical countermeasures (MCMs) and devices. These ideas could not only lead to revolutionary products and technologies in health security- related patient care but also lend themselves to more novel approaches to develop, procure and deploy/distribute MCMs in a public health emergency. DRIVe has identified the following areas in which performers could propose their disruptive and innovative solutions: • Vaccine and Drug Administration: Increase compliance and improve outcomes. Examples might include technologies that lead to alternative routes of administration; needle-less, micro- needle and other types of drug delivery platforms. The goal is to improve efficacy and reduce the logistical burden of ancillary equipment, adjuvants and multiple-dose regimens that is associated with the current mode of vaccine and drug administration. • Clinical Diagnostics: Empower individuals and clinicians with early, actionable information. Examples include the application of technologies such as next generation diagnostics to revolutionize laboratory or near-patient testing to provide faster results for capturing and predicting health events so that timely responses and medical interventions can be deployed. • Development and Manufacturing: Enable rapid drug development, and distributed or decentralized manufacturing. For example, vaccines and/or medical countermeasures that can be 17 produced and delivered on-demand in a distributed fashion by technologies such as 3-D printing and other advances that adopt modular approaches to vaccine production. • Therapeutics: Develop universal therapeutics with broad-spectrum efficacy. For example new host-based drug targets, immunomodulators and microbiome-based therapeutics that can lead to new treatment opportunities for infectious diseases that threaten our national health security. The examples provided above are pointers to some novel ideas and are by no means exhaustive. Performers are encouraged to submit innovative technologies which may not fit into the above categories but have the ability to impact health security in threat areas that are highly relevant to BARDA, namely chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear as well as in the areas of pandemic and emerging infectious disease threats. VII. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables Some reports and other deliverables are relevant to specific activities performed during the period of performance under the contract, grant, or agreement. The Respondent and the Government will agree during final negotiations which reports and other deliverables are relevant and will be required as deliverables as determined in the negotiated final SOW. Reports required will be prepared and delivered throughout performance, and should be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Adobe Acrobat PDF, and/or data-fields to a Government identified system. A. Reports 1. Technical Progress Reports: The frequency of Technical Progress Reporting will be determined by the Government during negotiations. Typically, on the 20th day of each month, the Respondent must submit a Technical Progress Report describing activities performed during the previous calendar month. The appropriate formats for the Technical Progress Report will be provided by the Government. The Technical Progress Reports may include project timelines and summaries of product manufacturing, testing, and clinical evaluation activities as applicable. A Technical Progress Report will not be required for the month in which the Final Report is due. 2. Final Report: By the expiration date of selected procurement instrument, the Respondent will submit a Final Report that details, documents, and summarizes the results of all work performed under the contract. B. Meetings The Respondent will participate in regular meetings to coordinate and oversee the contract effort as directed by the CO, CS, OTAO, and Contracting Officer Representative (COR), Other Transaction Agreement Technical Representative and other Government technical representatives as required. Such meetings may include, but are not limited to, all Respondent and subcontractors to discuss technical progress, transition activities, schedule, cost, regulatory issues, or other relevant activities. 18 Recurring teleconferences between the Respondent and subcontractors and the Government may be held to review technical progress. The Government reserves the right to request more frequent teleconferences and face-to-face meetings depending on the nature and importance of the work being performed. The Respondent will receive feedback from the Government during the teleconference regarding contract performance. The Respondent will have an opportunity to respond and recommend corrective actions. The only contractual relationship will be between the Government and the prime Respondent. C. Program Management Plans and Documentation 1. Product Development Plan (PDP): Within one month of the effective date of an award, the successful Respondent may be required to submit a PDP, which will be approved by the CO, or OTAO prior to initiation of any activities related to their implementation. Part of the Project plan should include a Gantt chart and an identified risks and mitigation table. 2. Commercialization Plan: As requested. VIII. Intermittent Pausing of New Abstract Submissions Acceptance of abstracts submitted under this EZ-BAA may temporarily be placed on hold as a result of a lack of available of funding. Notices of these intermissions, if necessary, will be communicated via modification to the EZ-BAA posted on www.beta.sam.gov. IX. Special Instructions to the EZ-BAA Special instructions may be required and will be advertised via the EZ-BAA announcement on www.beta.sam.gov. Any Special Instructions announcement issued would describe a specific research interest and could address any topic within the BARDA mission space. Special Instructions announcements may require instructions tailored to the specific needs of Government requirements, but no resulting award shall exceed the size and scope of awards defined above.

See relevant dates above for open periods of submissions. As stated in the EZ-BAA itself, scheduling a call with the relevant Program Manager is strongly encouraged prior to any submission to better understand the program objectives for each research area. The points of contact for each open AOI are listed above. AOI #1: Early Notification to Act, Control and Treat (ENACT) The ability to detect illness and injury early is critical to improving health outcomes and decreasing burden on health care providers and facilities. Through ENACT, DRIVe is seeking technologies and methods to a) identify and characterize biological, behavioral, and physiological signatures that can signal infection or injury before the onset of noticeable symptoms and b) technologies that provide early health status information to medical care providers. Applications may but do not have to focus on COVID-19 as a potential use case. To be considered responsive under this topic, technologies should prioritize host- based diagnostics and have one or more of the following desired characteristics: • Technologies should provide quantitation of host-based biophysical and biochemical health markers through sensors that can be deployed and used by anyone with minimal training. Wearable, continuously operating sensors and sensor suites that monitor an individuals’ innate and adaptive immunity are preferred; • Wearable sensors or sensor suites in form factors that facilitate human use (e.g. microneedle patches, smart band-aids, smart tattoos, eye and oral sensors) are particularly desired; • Applicants should prioritize sensors or sensor suites that collect and interpret data autonomously, although they can be coupled with cloud- based data reporting and analytics; • For on-demand sensing, non-invasive or minimally invasive sensors (such as those using a finger stick) are required; • Technologies that quantify the composition of passive samples (e.g. saliva, interstitial fluid, sweat, breath etc.) are of special interest; • Technological approaches should include algorithms and smartphone applications for early indication of health status and optimally directing patients and allocating treatment resources in a large-scale health security event; • Proposals should develop algorithmic and automated approaches to link sensor data to early or presymptomatic disease and injury detection. Respondents should discuss their approach to obtaining regulatory approval for mailto:chemrepo@hhs.gov mailto:BeyondTheNeedle@hhs.gov their technology and commercialization. All proposed clinical studies must equitably include multiple racial and ethnic groups and all clinical data analyses must include race / ethnicity and biological sex as subject groups. The ENACT team has retrospective and prospective wearables data including heart rate, heart rate variability, accelerometer, electrocardiogram, and other health signature data sets that may be made available for data analytics, algorithm development, and data mining. The program will support the development and validation of models from prospective partners and can make de-identified clinical data sets available. The following areas are considered to be out of scope at this time and may not be reviewed: • Pathogen based detection or technologies – any technologies that are based on the identification of pathogens will not be considered responsive at this time. • Any technology that is not minimally invasive and simple to use. Specifically, for purposes of this AOI, technologies which require sample preparation and would not be available over-the-counter and cleared / approved by FDA for home use, will be considered non-responsive. (with the exception of app-based solutions). NOTE: All awarded ENACT partners will be required to share de-identified data collected during the period of performance in an effort to advance the field and knowledge. Interested partners are encouraged to commercialize their technology and algorithms but data collected through the use of Government funding will be made available through full Government purpose rights. AOI #2: Infection Severity & Solving Sepsis At least 1.7 million Americans develop sepsis each year and nearly 270,000 Americans die annually as a result. Sepsis occurs when an infection leads to a dysregulated host response and organ dysfunction. In addition to the toll on health, sepsis incurs a large economic burden and sepsis survivors also sustain additional chronic illnesses and associated care expenses. Sepsis can be the endpoint of almost any infection, including SARS-CoV2, and therefore recognition, early detection and mitigation are critical at the first signs of sepsis. We consider sepsis to be a continuum of infection progression that is further complicated by the heterogeneity of the host response and organ dysfunction. Within the program, we are catalyzing the field through a coordinated approach towards development of innovative host-based diagnostics, host-targeted therapeutics, and clinical management approaches that will advance the way we recognize infection severity, combat sepsis, build resiliency in our healthcare system, improve patient outcomes, and ensure that no American life is needlessly cut short by sepsis. As sepsis can be a complication of any health security threat, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to fully protect Americans and save lives, the Solving Sepsis program aims to reduce the incidence, morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of sepsis. The program desires to empower both the patient and the healthcare provider with technologies and approaches that are relevant in a number of care settings, including pre-hospital (e.g., home, nursing homes, outpatient), urgent/emergency care (e.g., EMS transport, Emergency Department), inpatient (e.g., ward, ICU) and post-discharge/recovery (e.g., home, skilled nursing facilities). BARDA is interested in technologies and approaches that apply to adults and special populations, such as neonates and pediatric patients, as all populations are at risk of sepsis. The program is interested in the following focus areas. Please note that due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 may be an appropriate use case: 1. Host-based diagnostics, monitoring devices and predictive analytics tool: a. Diagnostics and monitoring devices that identify sepsis, predict infection severity, or prognosticate outcomes in pre-hospital settings, urgent/emergency care, or post-discharge/recovery settings. We are not interested in tools that can be used exclusively for inpatient settings at this time. The diagnostics must be able to distinguish infection or mild disease alone from severe outcomes, including sepsis, or distinguish from Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) in the absence of infection. b. Pediatric technologies that improve early detection and diagnosis and/or inform on clinical management of pediatric/neonatal patient progression to sepsis and other severe outcomes, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). c. Post-sepsis (or post COVID-19) monitoring technologies (e.g., after hospital discharge) to detect health deterioration or changes in health outcomes, to inform on clinical care. These technologies should not just provide absolute data values but also include approaches to interpret/analyze data and provide actionable information to the healthcare provider or patient. d. Patient stratification/endotyping/sub-typing technologies to provide a more tailored approach to improve clinical management in certain subpopulations and potentially correlate with individualized targeted treatment responses (See section 2 below). 2. Host-targeted therapeutics and clinical management approaches: a. Novel host-based sepsis therapeutic approaches that can modulate the host response to improve patient outcomes. b. Novel clinical management strategies that can be tied to patient stratification approaches (see section 1.d above) to improve patient outcomes. Submissions should be responsive to the following: • Medical countermeasures should address infection via any etiology (i.e., bacterial, viral, other) versus approaches that are limited to sepsis induced by a subset of pathogens. However, due the current COVID-19 pandemic, approaches that use COVID-19 as a use case, are appropriate. • Provide evidence of planned adoption or implementation strategies in relevant settings to improve clinical utility of the proposed technology (pre- hospital (e.g. Home, nursing homes, outpatient), urgent/emergency care (e.g. EMS transport, Emergency Department) and post-discharge/recovery (e.g. home, nursing homes). • Proposals should include prior demonstration and preliminary data to support use in sepsis or infection severity relevant models (e.g., sepsis patient samples, sepsis [including severe COVID-19] patient clinical data). • Only technologies focused on host-based approaches or clinical management approaches will be considered. BARDA has existing programs for pathogen- targeted approaches outside of this Area of Interest. • Research should be considered translational science. There is no interest in early stage or fundamental research projects for this topic at this time. • Proposals should present a clear FDA regulatory path for approval/clearance (if appropriate) and, if available, evidence of engagement with regulatory authorities. • Proposals should provide evidence of pre-established agreements with proposed partners for relevant clinical studies, if appropriate. • Proposals should include consideration of commercialization strategy outside the work proposed to this announcement. This may include other ongoing relevant research; establishment of partnerships with appropriate device fabricators/manufacturers; addressing the ability to scale, deploy, and distribute the medical countermeasure; intellectual property; and modeling the cost per unit, reimbursement strategy, etc. • Clinical studies must be equitable in terms of enrollment, including diversity amongst race, ethnicity, and biological sex. • Diagnostic approaches may leverage a number of innovative areas including host biomarkers, artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms, digital health, EHR integration, data interoperability, remote and self-monitoring devices, etc. The following are considered out of scope at this time: • Pathogen-based or pathogen targeted approaches, including serology • Physiological monitoring devices that do not distinguish mild disease or infection alone from severe outcomes, including sepsis, or distinguish from SIRS in the absence of infection • Devices or technologies that only address prevention or detection of infection and do not address infection severity or sepsis • Supportive care technologies that do not specifically improve clinical outcomes for sepsis patients • Sepsis diagnostics that are limited to only the intensive care unit hospital setting • Exploratory research with no near-term translational application • Technologies that will require FDA regulatory approval but have not yet engaged or do not have an appropriate regulatory path AOI #5: ReDIRECT (Repurposing Drugs In Response to Chemical Threats) The availability of effective medical countermeasures (MCMs) against chemical threats are critical in the treatment of their acute health effects. Necessary attributes of effective MCMs against chemical threats include ease of administration during a mass-casualty situation and rapid efficacy as a post- exposure therapy. Drug repurposing is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for FDA approved or late-stage investigational therapeutics that are outside of their original clinical indication. The identification of existing compounds for repurposing as MCMs holds the potential to expand current response capabilities to chemical threats, as well as potentially mitigating the costs and risks associated with conventional drug discovery. BARDA is requesting abstract submissions for projects that repurpose existing therapeutics as MCMs against chemical threats (cyanide, opioids, nerve agents, chlorine, sulfur mustard, etc.). These therapeutics should have a strong mechanistic justification for potential use as MCMs. Ideal candidates for MCMs should have a known safety profile from previous clinical indications or development and be safe and effective for the entire population, including at-risk populations such as pediatrics, geriatrics, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. MCM candidates should: (1) Already be approved or in late-stage clinical development for a conventional indication similar to the symptomology associated with exposure to a chemical agent; and (2) Utilize improved delivery routes or mechanisms that provide ease of administration (including, but not limited to, reformulation of existing products) to large numbers of exposed individuals during mass casualty situations. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. Therapeutics that are eligible for drug repurposing may target any of the following: Pulmonary Agents: Development of MCMs to prevent and treat lung damage (including pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, and fibrosis) resulting from exposure to agents such as chlorine, sulfur mustard and phosgene. Opioids: Development of MCMs to treat life-threatening respiratory depression caused by opioid overdose. These post-exposure treatments should be quick- acting and effective against a variety of opioids, including synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl. Candidates should have a mechanism of action different from existing opioid receptor antagonists. Vesicants: Development of MCMs that limit harmful aspects of exposure to vesicating agents such as sulfur mustard and Lewisite. Particular preference is given to drugs with potential to ameliorate the long term effects of exposure including Mustard Gas Keratopathy. Blood/Metabolic Agents: Development of MCMs to treat acute poisoning from agents such as cyanides. Antidotes should be easily administered by first responders in personal protective equipment. Preference is given to those cyanide antidotes that are also effective against smoke inhalation-related exposure. Nerve Agents and Organophosphorus (OP) Pesticides: Development of MCMs to treat life-threatening and long-term effects of nerve agents and OP pesticides. Antidotes should be easily administered by first responders in personal protective equipment. Computational approaches to identify candidates for drug repurposing: Development of improved methods to rapidly identify FDA approved or late stage candidate compounds that can be repurposed against any of the aforementioned chemical threats. To be considered responsive under this AOI, respondents should have: (1) A drug that is a candidate for repurposing as a MCM against pulmonary agents, opioids, vesicants, blood/metabolic agents, nerve agents, or organophosphate pesticides; and (2) A FDA approved drug, or one that has completed Phase 2 trials as evidenced by a clinical study report; and (3) A clear rationale as to why the candidate would be efficacious as a chemical MCM. Priority will be given to MCMs developed in the United States. AOI #6: Beyond the Needle The administration of therapeutics, such as vaccines, biologics, or other medications, can be markedly enhanced by utilizing alternative routes of administration that rely less on a needle and syringe approach used in traditional intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or subcutaneous (SC) administrations. These traditional routes via a needle and syringe are often logistically challenging, rely on cold-chain storage that hinders distribution, and almost exclusively require experienced personnel for administration. The DRIVe Beyond the Needle program seeks to develop technologies that (1) utilize alternative routes of administration for administering therapeutics, such as but not limited to: oral, intranasal, transdermal patches, sublingual, and buccal mechanisms of administration, (2) involve simplified logistics that enable easier deployment and uptake, and (3) able to be administered without a trained health-care professional. As a consequence to reduce production costs, the medical supply industry has evolved to “just-in-time” supply chain models that involve sourcing and manufacturing raw materials outside the United States. As a result, the domestic availability of needle and syringes is limited and poses as a bottleneck for therapies requiring their use on a large scale. In recent months, the pandemic has highlighted opportunities to strengthen and bolster the United States medical supply chain. The Beyond the Needle program seeks to develop therapeutics that can be administered in a broad range of care settings including within the home and do not rely on skilled medical personnel for administration. A successful alternative technology for administration would reduce the demand placed on qualified personnel, particularly in communities that are underserved and have reduced access to care. BARDA is seeking abstracts for the development of technology that features an alternative route of administration for any type of payload, including vaccines, drugs (biologics, small molecules, nucleic acids), as well as adjuvants against CBRN threats, Influenza (seasonal/pandemic), coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), and other emerging infectious diseases that is of pandemic concern as outlined on www.medicalcountermeasures.gov. The ideal attributes for therapeutics or adjuvants delivered via alternative routes of administration would be single dose (although additional dosing is acceptable), room temperature-stable without the need for cold-chain storage, and indicated for all populations. Therapeutics delivered via alternate routes of administration should have similar or superior performance characteristics as traditional routes administered via a needle and syringe (i.e. safety and efficacy). Emphasis will be placed on proposals that focus on the delivery and not on the discovery of payloads. In some cases, alignment with a proven therapeutic provider might be beneficial, although it is not required for consideration. All submissions must include: 1. A proposed technology or platform for administering a therapeutic (can include vaccines, biologics, small molecules, nucleic acids etc.) candidate via an alternative route of administration. Therapeutics may target CBRN threats, Influenza (seasonal/pandemic), SARS-CoV-1 / 2, as seen on (www.medicalcountermeasures.gov) but are not required. 2. Plans for IND enabling pre-clinical studies or provide existing supporting data. 3. Product development plan and a target product profile is desired. 4. Any regulatory communication with US FDA (pre-IND/IND). 5. Any pre-clinical or clinical data using this platform. 6. Potential for use or implementation in underserved communities. D. Eligible Respondents & Scope Parameters: These Special Instructions are open to all responsible sources as described in the EZ-BAA and subsequent amendments / special instructions.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW INFORMATION A. Development Opportunity Objective: Under these Special Instructions 003, BARDA is adding a new topics under its temporary AOI #4: COVID-19 as part of its EZ-BAA (BAA-20-100-SOL-0002). We are now seeking abstract submissions for the following: AOI #4.1-A: Molecular Diagnostic Assay for SARS-CoV-2 virus on existing FDA- cleared platform The development and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of an in vitro diagnostic assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) RNA in clinical specimens, including upper (e.g, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate, or nasal aspirate) and lower (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate, or sputum) respiratory tract specimens. The assay must be developed for use with an existing FDA-cleared molecular platform that is currently widely placed in U.S. healthcare settings. Preference will be given to respondents who present a viable plan that achieves an EUA submission milestone within 12 weeks of award. As part of the abstract submission, respondents should describe the current development status of their SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) assay, including in silico analysis of targets, access to validation materials to support EUA submission, and contacts with the FDA. Priority will be given to products manufactured in the United States. AOI #4.1-B: Point-of-Care Diagnostic Assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus The development and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of an in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., virus, viral RNA, or viral antigens) in respiratory specimens that has a small footprint (e.g., hand-held), is easy to use at the point of care (i.e., suitable for use in CLIA-waived settings) and produces results in less than 30 minutes (less than 15 minutes preferred).

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW INFORMATION A. Development Opportunity Objective: Under these Special Instructions 007, BARDA is closing topics #4.1-B and #4.1-C under its temporary AOI #4: COVID-19 as part of its EZ-BAA (BAA-20-100-SOL- 0002). We are now seeking abstract submissions for the following: AOI #4.1-A: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-B: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-C: [CLOSED] AOI #4.1-D: Remote Patient Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools The development of adjunctive diagnostic technologies with near-term impact that are critical to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our health infrastructure during the COVID-19 outbreak. These technologies may empower the patient through providing a means of self-monitoring or diagnosis, or empower the healthcare provider through enabling remote monitoring or diagnostic capability throughout the care continuum of the patient – i.e. pre-hospital, inpatient, and post-discharge. There is also a need to rapidly assess and diagnose severity of illness in order to triage patients for care or to aid in early recognition of decompensation for improved clinical management of patients. Current technology emphasis includes telehealth applications, wearables, non- invasive (or minimally invasive) sensors or algorithm-based tools. These technologies should be capable of capturing and quantifying a broad range of host biological, immunological, biometric, clinical, laboratory, and/or physiological data. In addition, technologies that incorporate novel informatics approaches to data collection, reporting, and analysis are of interest. To be considered relevant under this topic, technologies should meet the following requirements: 1) Ability to be rapidly scaled and deployed under an accelerated timeline of less than 90 days. Software tools should be able to be deployed in less than 30 days. 2) Ability to demonstrate potential utility for COVID-19. 3) Require minimal infrastructure or training to deploy and support. 4) Achieved FDA regulatory clearance/approval or have identified a clear regulatory path for deployment, if applicable to technology. 5) An innovative approach to addressing COVID-19 is preferred. 6) Manufactured components in the United States are desired.
