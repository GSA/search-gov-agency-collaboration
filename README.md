# Read Me: search-gov-agency-collaboration

This repo is to facilitate collaboration on indexing and transfer of large files from agency teams to Search.gov.

Agency team members must be approved by the Search.gov team to be able to post files here. [Request access](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov).

**Before uploading files to this repo:**

* Check to see whether your agency has a folder already dedicated to it.
* If a folder exists, upload your files to that folder.
* If a folder does not exist, you can create one, or [contact the Search.gov team](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) for assistance.

We look forward to working with you!
